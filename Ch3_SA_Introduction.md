# Can saccadic adaptation improveme both action and perception?

The previous chapter demonstrates that prism adaptation fails to
improve performance on both spatial working memory and temporal
estimation tasks. This can be explained by the dorsal-ventral
dissassociation. These tasks were chosen because of their perceptual
nature. If prisms influence dorsal stream functioning [tk], and
these tasks are dominantly tests of ventral stream functioning, then
it follows that these specially chosen perceptual tasks will not be
substantially remediated by prisms in neglect.

Prism adaptation by design influences both visual and proprioceptive
frames of reference [@Redding2005]. In fact, depending on the
specifics of the adaptation protocol, the bulk of the influence of
prisms can be exclusively in the proprioceptive reference frame
[@Redding2005]. The protocol used in the previous chapter employed
concurrent visual feedback, where the participant is not prevented
from seeing his hand throughout the movement. This is likely to have
lead to a predominantly proprioceptive reference frame realinement.

FIXME: After reading the Redding and Rosetti papers, I am not sure
what to make of this. It's confusing the hell out of me.

Why would changes in a proprioceptive frame of reference lead to
after effects influencing visual perceptual representations?

[Saccadic adaptation as an alternative] Another visuomotor
adaptation procedure, called saccadic adaptation, offers a potential
alternative approach to rehabilitating neglect that may overcome
some of the shortcomings of prism adaptation. This is because
saccades straddle the perceptual and motor systems in a highly
unique way. Saccadic adaptation is a form of sensory adaptation,
because it changes input to the visual system. At the same time
saccadic adaptation is also motor adaptation, as it is fundamentally
the parameters of motor action execution, not sensitivity, that is
adapted. Unlike prisms, which shift the ocular position of "straight
ahead," realigning both visuomotor and limb-proprioceptive reference
frames, saccadic adaptation changes the saccade motor plan, directly
biasing eye movements, and thus providing a different, and perhapse more
direct way of influencing visual perceptual representations.

There are other differences between the two tasks that may make
saccadic adaptation more useful in neglect. For example; unlike
other adaptive systems, saccads are unable make corrections
in-flight due to the lack of useful visual feedback throughout the
duration of the action [@Matin1982]. Therefore, they are, by nature,
ballistic, relying on error signals after each event to maintain
highly accurate motor plans. This may be valuable in neglect as
patients tend toward slow, labourious, pointing gestures, and prism
adaptation benefits from faster, more fluid movement [tk?].

[Saccades adapt to a wide range of perturbations] Because of the
limitations of vision during eye movements, the saccadic system must
rely on errors to maintain precision [@Wong2010]. As a result, the
saccade accuracy can be maintained in the face of a wide range of
perterbations, from ocular muscle paresis or injury [@Kommerell1976]
, weakness due to aging [@Kommerell1976], or the wearing of
magnifying glasses on one or both eyes [@Kommerell1976]. There
exists a rich, half-century of investigation into the saccadic
adaptation system. Most of it relying on a behavioral saccadic
adaptation paradigm, developed by @mclaughlin1967, that utilizes target
purturbations presented during saccades.


[describe saccade adaptation procedure and classic results] Saccadic
adaptation involves the systemic purturbation of targets while the
viewier is making eye movemens. If purturbations are configured such
that saccades seem to over-shoot their target, then they become
shorter over time  [@mclaughlin1967]. The same can be done to
lengthen saccades, though the mechanisms may be somewhat different
[@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008, @Panouillères2009,
@Panouillères2012].


[Retinotopic] Saccadic adaptation operates in a retinocentric
reference frame. That is to say, the starting eye position is
irrelevant, but only the vector direction of the eye movement
[@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008, @Panouillères2009,
@Panouillères2012]. For example, if rightward saccades of 10 degrees
are reduced by saccadic adaptation, other simmilar rightward
saccades will be hypometric, regardless of the eye or head position.
Congruent with a retinocentric vector-based representation,
adaptation of saccades of a given length will continue to affect simmilar
but not drastically different length saccades
[@Miller1981;@Frens1994;@Albano1996;@Straube1997], and horizontal
and vertical adaptation are also independent of one-another
[@Watanabe2003]. Perhapse most indicitive of a purely retinotopic
reference frame, adaptation of saccades of one direction do not
influence saccades of the oposite direction, regardless of spatial
overlap [@Deubel1986;@Frens1994;@Albano1996].



Inducing changes in a retinocentric frame of reference could potentially
influence a broader range of behaviours important for both attention and the
accurate construction of perceptual representations.

Perceptual Effects of Saccadic Adaptation
-----------------------------------------

### Transient modifications of spatial perception occurs around saccade

[By nature, saccades influence perception] Saccades are the motor action
that has the potential for the strongest influence on visual perception.
Eye movements are continually responsible for the content of what is fed
to the perceptual streams, as they direct our gaze and dictate where and
when we acquire the visual information which provides the pieces with
which we construct our internal representation of the visual world. In a
complementary way, saccades have the ability to *mask* large changes in
the visual scene through saccadic suppression, producing a perceptual
system that is, in a way, forever subservient to action systems.

FIXME: Useful?: Eye movements are strongly coupled to goal-direction
actions [@Neggers2001GazeAnchoring!].

[Sensitivity to motion] One way the effects of saccadic adaptation on
perception may be measured is by trying to induce perceptual biases in
the adapted field. In an early such task, @Mack1978 found that when a
vertical gain was added to horizontal saccades by perturbing lateral
targets upward, participants became desensitized to upward motion and
sensitized to downward motion. In other words, their threshold for
detecting upward motion was increased, and downward motion, decreased
[@Mack1978].

[Spatial mislocalization] Another way of examining the way saccadic
adaptation can bias perception is to test subjective judgment of the
locations of targets in the adapted field. is by testing for
mislocalization of targets in the adapted field. @Zimmermann2009

[Clearly, SA can have an effect on perception] Though there is limited
research into the perceptual effects of saccadic adaptation, there is a
clear convergence of evidence that it occurs...

\#\#\# Saccadic Adaptation for Patients with Perceptual Biases

[SA has untested potential for perceptual disorders] While other tasks
with similar heritage, like prism adaptation, have been extensively used
in clinical research applications, saccadic adaptation has remained
predominantly in the realm of psychophysics and tk (healthy
participants). There are some exceptions, mostly in disorders involving
cerebellar degeneration, but generally, the task may has not been
examined for use understanding perceptual and vision disorders.

**METHODS, Results Discussion**

\
\

Qualitative description of case study: Launch the argument here that
failures (in SA and PA) are due to techniques that influence reflexive,
reactive mechanisms. Another point to make here is that neglect patients
never say there’s anything unusual about the prisms – that is, they are
not aware of the shift despite adapting to it – more evidence that the
effects are implicit.
