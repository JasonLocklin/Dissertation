# Can saccadic adaptation improve both action and perception?

The previous chapter demonstrates that prism adaptation fails to improve
performance on both spatial working memory and temporal estimation
tasks. This can be explained by the dorsal-ventral disassociation.
These tasks were chosen because of their perceptual nature. If prisms
influence dorsal stream functioning, and these tasks are dominantly
tests of ventral stream functioning, then it follows that these
specially chosen perceptual tasks will not be substantially remediated
by prisms in neglect [@Striemer2010].

Prism adaptation by design influences both visual and proprioceptive
frames of reference [@Redding2005]. In fact, depending on the
specifics of the adaptation protocol, the bulk of the influence of
prisms can be exclusively in the proprioceptive reference frame
[@Redding2005]. The protocol used in the previous chapter employed
concurrent visual feedback, where the participant is not prevented
from seeing his hand throughout the movement. This is likely to have
lead to a predominantly proprioceptive reference frame realignment, however, regardless
of the type of feedback, prism adaptation leads to a mix of proprioceptive
and visual, or perceptual, effects, the degree to which each of these is
present is contentious [@Redding2005, @Herlihey2012]..

[Saccadic adaptation as an alternative] Another visuomotor adaptation
procedure, called saccadic adaptation, offers a potential alternative
approach to rehabilitating neglect that may overcome some of the
shortcomings of prism adaptation. This is because saccades straddle the
perceptual and motor systems in a highly unique way. Saccadic adaptation
is a form of sensory adaptation, because it changes input to the visual
system. At the same time saccadic adaptation is also motor adaptation,
as it is fundamentally the parameters of motor action execution, not
sensitivity, that is adapted. Unlike prisms, which shift the ocular
position of "straight ahead," realigning both visuomotor and
limb-proprioceptive reference frames, saccadic adaptation changes the
saccade motor plan, directly biasing eye movements, and thus providing a
different, and perhaps more direct way of influencing visual perceptual
representations.

There are other differences between the two tasks that may make
saccadic adaptation more useful rehabilitating in neglect. For example;
unlike other adaptive systems, saccades are unable make corrections
in-flight due to the lack of useful visual feedback throughout the
duration of the action [@Matin1982]. Therefore, they are, by nature,
ballistic, relying on error signals after each event to maintain highly
accurate motor plans. This may be valuable in neglect as patients tend
toward slow, laborious, pointing gestures, and prism adaptation
benefits from faster, more fluid movement [@Redding2005]

[Saccades adapt to a wide range of perturbations] Because of the
limitations of vision during eye movements, the saccadic system must
rely on errors to maintain precision [@Wong2010]. As a result, the
saccade accuracy can be maintained in the face of a wide range of
perturbations, from ocular muscle paresis or injury [@Kommerell1976]
, weakness due to aging [@Kommerell1976], or the wearing of
magnifying glasses on one or both eyes [@Kommerell1976]. There
exists a rich, half-century of investigation into the saccadic
adaptation system. Most of it relying on a behavioural saccadic
adaptation paradigm, developed by @mclaughlin1967, that utilizes target
perturbations presented during saccades.


[describe saccade adaptation procedure and classic results] Saccadic
adaptation involves the systemic perturbation of targets while the
participant is making eye movements. If perturbations are configured such
that saccades seem to over-shoot their target, then they become
shorter over time  [@mclaughlin1967]. The same can be done to
lengthen saccades, though the mechanisms may be somewhat different
[@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008, @Panouillères2009,
@Panouillères2012].


[Retinotopic] Saccadic adaptation operates in a retinocentric
reference frame. That is to say, the starting eye position is
irrelevant, but only the vector direction of the eye movement
[@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008, @Panouillères2009,
@Panouillères2012]. For example, if rightward saccades of 10 degrees
are reduced by saccadic adaptation, other similar rightward
saccades will be hypometric, regardless of the eye or head position.
Congruent with a retinocentric vector-based representation,
adaptation of saccades of a given length will continue to affect similar
but not drastically different length saccades
[@Miller1981;@Frens1994;@Albano1996;@Straube1997], and horizontal
and vertical adaptation are also independent of one-another
[@Watanabe2003]. Perhaps most indicative of a purely retinotopic
reference frame, adaptation of saccades of one direction do not
influence saccades of the opposite direction, regardless of spatial
overlap [@Deubel1986;@Frens1994;@Albano1996].  Inducing changes in a
retinocentric frame of reference could potentially influence a broader
range of behaviours important for both attention and the accurate
construction of perceptual representations.



[Perception] There is also several lines of research that indicate that
saccadic adaptation can influence perception. For example, @Mack1978
found that when a vertical gain was added to horizontal saccades by
perturbing targets upward, participants became desensitized to upward
motion and sensitized to downward motion.  In other words, their
threshold for detecting upward motion was increased, and downward
motion, decreased [@Mack1978]. Perception of the spatial location of
targets presented before or during saccades can be biased by saccadic
adaptation [@Awater2005, @Georg2008, @Bruno2007, @Zimmermann2009]. And
the pre-saccadic attentional shift can also be influenced by saccadic
adaptation [@Dore-Mazars2005, @Collins2006]. It could be claimed that
the perceptual effects above occur only near saccades, but saccadic
adaptation can also induce biases in the perception of spatial extent in
the absence of eye movements [@Garaas2008], providing a good set of
converging evidence that saccadic adaptation can influence perception.


The current chapter sets out to examine the potential for saccadic
adaptation as a rehabilitative tool for neglect. However, the application
of saccadic adaptation in clinical research has not been well
established.  Where it has, it has almost exclusively been with
disorders involving cerebellar degeneration, and not cortical disorders
like neglect. In one notable exception, saccadic adaptation was used to
improve reading speed and performance on a serial visual search task in
hemianopic patients [@Lvy-Bencheton2012].  It has also been successfully
used to improve reading ability in an elderly patient with an acquired
oculomotor apraxia and other degenerative disorders that caused gaze
abnormalities [@Desestret2013]. Despite the dearth of research, the
clinical application of saccadic adaptation on disorders like neglect is
under-examined.


# Experiment 1 - Saccadic Adaptation and Judgment of Centre (normative)

As described in the previous chapter, perceptual and motoric judgments
of centre, in the form of the line bisection and landmark tasks, provide
a simple, yet clear demonstration of the dissociative effects of
prisms in neglect. In order to examine the potential of saccadic
adaptation, the performance of a group of healthy participants on these
tasks were measured over several sessions of saccadic adaptation.

# Experiment 2 - Case Study Examining Saccadic Adaptation in Neglect

An experimental trial of saccadic adaptation with a neglect patient was
performed in order to gauge the feasibility of using the task with this
population, and to look for potential indicators of efficacy. 

## Methods 

[brief description of patient and protocol; brief description of
results; could you make a figure that has eye traces for controls vs.
eye traces for Brian?]

## Results and Discussion

Qualitative description of case study: Launch the argument here that
failures (in SA and PA) are due to techniques that influence reflexive,
reactive mechanisms. Another point to make here is that neglect patients
never say there’s anything unusual about the prisms – that is, they are
not aware of the shift despite adapting to it – more evidence that the
effects are implicit.
