# Can saccadic adaptation improveme both action and perception?




The previous chapter demonstrates that prism adaptation fails to improve
performance on both spatial working memory and temporal estimation 
tasks. This can be explained by the dorsal-ventral dissassociation. These tasks
were chosen because of their perceptual nature. If prisms influence dorsal
stream functioning [tk] and these tasks are dominantly ventral stream, it
follows that these tasks and ones like them will not be substantially
remediated by prisms in neglect.


Prism adaptation by design influences both visual and proprioceptive frames of
reference\ (Redding and Wallace refs - 2006). In fact, depending on the
specifics of the adaptation protocol, the bulk of the influence of prisms is
seen on proprioceptive tasks (refs).




After-effects tend to be about 40% of the shift; vision account for around 10%
of the after-effects and proprioception the rest. [don’t use actual numbers –
“Depending on the procedure employed, the bulk of the after-effect is seen in a
proprioceptive reference frame. Might need to address what we did – concurrent
feedback? So that procedure does not bias towards proprioceptive changes as
dramatically as terminal feedback but could still be biased in that direction]

Why would changes in a proprioceptive frame of reference lead to after effects
influencing visual perceptual representations?

Saccadic adaptation offers an alternative approach to rehabilitating neglect
that may overcome some of the shortcomings of prism adapation.

\ \

[describe saccade adaptation procedure and classic results]

\ \

Saccadic adaptation operates in a retinocentric co-ordinate reference frame
(refs).

Inducing changes in a retinocentric frame of reference could potentially
influence a broader range of behaviours important for both attention and the
accurate construction of perceptual representations.

\ \

**the accurate construction of perceptual representations**




Saccades are precise motor movements that are usually programmed to move the
eyes to foviate a specific target. Saccadic suppression, and the speed
limitations of retinal cells, prevent visual information from reaching the
brain during the movement [@Matin1982], and thus the brain from making on-line
motor corrections, and yet, the eyes land reliably close to the target most of
the time. This ability to execute a pre-programmed motor movement with extreme
precision, reliably, and maintain that ability over a lifetime, despite
operating, essentially "blind," is a testament to one or more highly capable
underlying control systems.

**Could condense the above to a sentence.**

[accuracy is maintained through adaptation] Any motor system must incorporate a
realistic expectation of inaccuracy, and perform in way that minimizes
consequences. Because on-line feedback is not available
in this particular case, the visual motor system is forced to rely on
information gleaned after-the-fact, or, in other words, "error signals,"
to maintain effective control mechanism parameters [@Wong2010]. There
exists a rich, half-century of investigation into this short-term
parametric adaptation of saccades, or simply "saccadic adaptation,"
based on the original paradigm developed by @mclaughlin1967. Saccadic
adaptation tasks mimic and amplify oculomotor processes that occur
naturally and on a continual basis in humans. For example, neuromuscular
changes, such as a changes in the strength and function paresis of
ocular muscles due to paresis, injury [@Kommerell1976], or aging
[@warabi1984], or the wearing of magnifying glasses [@Erkelens1989],
result in some saccadic error, and the neuroplasticity underlying
saccadic adaptation permit correction so that vision is not impaired.
These types of perturbations can be monocular or binocular
[@Erkelens1989] and can effect saccadic accuracy in various
dimensions[@Chaturvedi1997].

\
\

**Condense the above – pair it with the sentence describing a saccade
and have the main point simply be – the system can adapt. “… adapts to a
wide range of perturbations.”**

[SA is motoric, but also perception -compare with prisms] There are two
characteristics that make saccadic adaptation a potentially valuable
alternative. First, unlike other adaptive systems, saccads are unable
make corrections in-flight due to the lack of useful visual feedback
throughout the duration of the action, so they are by nature, ballistic,
relying on error signals after each event to maintain precision. This
may be valuable in neglect as patients tend toward slow, labourious,
pointing gestures, and prism adaptation benefits from faster, more fluid
movement. Second, saccades straddle the perceptual and motor systems in
a highly unique way. Saccadic adaptation *is* a form of sensory
adaptation, because it changes the way the environment is perceived.
Vision is entirely dependent on where the eyes look, so when eye
movements change, the input to the visual systems are directly changes.
At the same time saccadic adaptation *is* motor adaptation, as it is
fundamentally the parameters of motor action execution, not sensitivity,
that is adapted. Prisms are similar, in this way, but involve different
systems. While SA effects the saccades motor plan, changing the
particular end-point in a person's visual periphery, Prisms don't
directly change eye movements. Instead, they shift the ocular position
of "straight ahead" in body-centric terms [tk].

\

**Keep the above – reads well**

Perceptual Effects of Saccadic Adaptation 
-----------------------------------------

### Transient modifications of spatial perception occurs around saccade 

[By nature, saccades influence perception] Saccades are the motor action
that has the potential for the strongest influence on visual perception.
Eye movements are continually responsible for the content of what is fed
to the perceptual streams, as they direct our gaze and dictate where and
when we acquire the visual information which provides the pieces with
which we construct our internal representation of the visual world. In a
complementary way, saccades have the ability to *mask* large changes in
the visual scene through saccadic suppression, producing a perceptual
system that is, in a way, forever subservient to action systems.

FIXME: Useful?: Eye movements are strongly coupled to goal-direction
actions [@Neggers2001GazeAnchoring!].

[Sensitivity to motion] One way the effects of saccadic adaptation on
perception may be measured is by trying to induce perceptual biases in
the adapted field. In an early such task, @Mack1978 found that when a
vertical gain was added to horizontal saccades by perturbing lateral
targets upward, participants became desensitized to upward motion and
sensitized to downward motion. In other words, their threshold for
detecting upward motion was increased, and downward motion, decreased
[@Mack1978].

[Spatial mislocalization] Another way of examining the way saccadic
adaptation can bias perception is to test subjective judgment of the
locations of targets in the adapted field. is by testing for
mislocalization of targets in the adapted field. @Zimmermann2009

[Perceptual shortening -long lasting] @Garaas2008

\
\

[Clearly, SA can have an effect on perception] Though there is limited
research into the perceptual effects of saccadic adaptation, there is a
clear convergence of evidence that it occurs...

\#\#\# Saccadic Adaptation for Patients with Perceptual Biases

[SA has untested potential for perceptual disorders] While other tasks
with similar heritage, like prism adaptation, have been extensively used
in clinical research applications, saccadic adaptation has remained
predominantly in the realm of psychophysics and tk (healthy
participants). There are some exceptions, mostly in disorders involving
cerebellar degeneration, but generally, the task may has not been
examined for use understanding perceptual and vision disorders.

\

**METHODS, Results Discussion**

\
\

Qualitative description of case study: Launch the argument here that
failures (in SA and PA) are due to techniques that influence reflexive,
reactive mechanisms. Another point to make here is that neglect patients
never say there’s anything unusual about the prisms – that is, they are
not aware of the shift despite adapting to it – more evidence that the
effects are implicit.

\

[SA involves a complicated set of mechanisms] It would be easy to assume
that saccadic adaptation occurs by the integration of a relatively
simple "error signal" into a type of universal saccadic "gain"
parameter. Ultimately, this does not appear to be the case. There is, in
fact, more than one type of error signal that the brain could make use
of, from motor afferent signals and the visual system, as well as
several possible parametric ways of changing saccade amplitude
[@Lappe2009]. This complex set of features make saccadic adaptation an
interesting way to investigate functional plasticity mechanisms in the
brain, and provides a clear contrast with prisms, for which the updating
mechanisms are not functionally equivalent. This comparable, but
functionally different response to saccadic relative to prism adaptation
may provide a profitable avenue for investigating, or even ameliorating
the asymmetrical attention problems in people with Unilateral Neglect or
other related disorders.

### Volitional and Reactive Saccades are Distinct

[Intro, reactive/express] Saccades, generally, can be subdivided into
two types based on function. Humans and most other visual animals
respond to sudden changes in peripheral space by orienting, and
typically foviating the stimuli. This is necessary in humans because of
impoverished retinal resolution and perceptual information processing in
the visual periphery. The need to quickly assess environmental changes
provides a universal drive to orients accurately and quickly toward such
stimuli, with little top-down interference.

[Volitional/endogenous] In contrast, self-directed investigation of an
environment by goal-directed, internally initiated saccades, such as in
visual search, requires a somewhat different strategy. Such saccades
are, by definition, going to involve a greater degree of entanglement
with conscious goal-monitoring mechanisms, and other high-level
cognitive systems. As such, unlike reactive saccades, these voluntary
saccades are very likely to involve move extensive functional brain
areas, and exhibit somewhat different characteristics. Besides different
functional brain structures, volitional and reactive saccades, also
called targeting and express saccades, respectively in the literature,
present different behavioural characteristics. For example, reactive
saccades exhibit very short latencies when compared with volitional
saccades [@Alahyane2007].

#### Different Systems and Properties. {.western}

[structural distinction] Saccades triggered by exogenous cues, like a
sudden movement or appearance of an object in the periphery are
considered reactive saccades and are typically contrasted with voluntary
saccades. Reactive saccades have much shorter latencies (as short as
100ms in humans), and are therefore thought to involve a smaller neural
architecture, perhaps restricted to early visual areas, superior
colliculus, and brain-stem [@Fischer1993]. Voluntary saccades are the
type of normal eye movements performed based on the execution and
monitoring of internal goals like searching for an object or monitoring
the progress of a manual task. While this distinction is less clear in
the cerebellum, it does seem to explain a degree of functional
specialization in the oculomotor areas of the cerebral cortex
[@Schraa-Tam2009,@Johnston2008,@Müri2008] and contribution of the
superior colliculus [@Schiller1987].

[SC] Animals with lesioned superior colliculus are unable to perform
reactive saccades, but retain the ability to generate saccades
endogenously [@Schiller1987]. When the frontal eye fields are also
lesioned, they lose this ability as well [@Schiller1987], indicating
unique structural dependencies for the two types of saccade. As a
result, it's valuable to keep in mind the distinction when comparing
results from experiments which may be utilizing different saccade types,
and when attempting to extrapolate mechanistic models based on simple
reactive saccades to more naturalistic behaviour.

[Cortex] @Schraa-Tam2009 used fMRI imaging to investigate the neural
correlates of saccade generation. In a direct comparison, self-paced,
voluntary eye movements elicited significantly different activation of
several cortical areas, including frontal eye fields, parietal eye
field, area MT/V5, the precunious, the angular and cingulate gyri, but
no change in cerebellar regions [@Schraa-Tam2009] . While area MT/V5, or
the motion sensitive area, was likely triggered because of the slight
difference in stimuli required to elicit reactive saccades, the other
activations indicate substantially unique cortical activation for
voluntary verses reactive saccades. This supports other research done
with primates that finds similar results [@Johnston2008]. A review of
lesion and TMS research by @Müri2008 also singles out the frontal eye
fields as being a critical component unique to voluntary saccades
[@Müri2008].

FIXME: If needed, papers examining the differing cognitive mechanisms
and behavioural characteristics (but not neural substrates) between
reactive and voluntary saccades [@Alahyane2007, @Collins2006,
@Cotti2007, @Cotti2009, @Deubel1995, @Erkelens1993, @Fujita2002,
@Zimmermann2009].

[caution when extrapolating or comparing the two] An appreciation for
the behavioural and functional differences between voluntary and
reactive saccades should inform any discussion of saccadic adaptation.
Most research into saccadic adaptation involves the adaptation of
reactive saccades, and there is a danger of overgeneralizing results
from this work to all eye movements. Results from the adaptation of
volitional saccades, or better yet, from research involving both types
of saccades, are always going to give a more reliable picture of the
mechanics of maintaining the effectiveness of voluntary eye movements.

Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results 
----------------------------------------------------

### Adaptation is not generalized 

[position and direction specificity] Some of the most reliable
characteristics found when investigating saccadic adaptation are
direction and magnitude specificity. While adaptation seems to
generalize to any starting eye position, only saccades similar to the
trained vector direction and magnitude show effects
[@Miller1981;@Frens1994;Noto1999;@Alahyane2004;@Alahyane2003].
Interestingly, the same lack of transfer can be found from one point to
another at a different depth in 3D peripersonal space [@Chaturvedi1997].
Others have found that when adapted in one meridian, there is limited
transfer to others [Lemij1992]. There also seems to be nearly strict
independence of horizontal and vertical adaptation [@Watanabe2003].
Adaptation of a particular saccade amplitude do not generalize to other
amplitudes [@Miller1981;@Frens1994;@Albano1996;@Straube1997]. And,
perhaps the most reliable and long-observed specificity is directional.
When, for example, leftward saccades are augmented or reduced with
saccadic adaptation, rightward saccades are unaffected, regardless of
the spatial position overlap [@Deubel1986;@Frens1994;@Albano1996].

[Rather than Cartesian specificity, spatial reference frames] The
different dimensions of adaptation described above can be re-phrased in
terms of spatial reference frames. Particular locations in retinal space
could be considered orbitocentric or retinocentric, depending on whether
starting position matters, while directional effects, or differences
between saccade reduction and augmentation can be thought of as
oculocentric. Saccadic adaptation seems to function in a way that is
primarily retina-referenced, rather than an orbitocentric [@Albano1996]

@Albano1996 had participants observe targets as they were displaced
horizontally across a computer scree, and indicate whenever the target
dimmed. The final position of one trial became the starting position of
the next, so that to the participant, the target seemingly moved
randomly back and forth across the screen. Intrasaccadic target
displacements were made in order to induce saccadic adaptation. They
were always horizontal, and when they occurred, always a 40 percent
change, either more or less than the initial saccadic distance at the
beginning of the trial. The resulting data

#### Augmentation and reduction are probably uniquely specialized. {.western}

[+-gain is important distinction]Probably the most extensively studied
dichotomy(?) of saccade adaptation is the difference between tasks that
lengthen or shorten saccades. Over the storied history of research into
the distinction, it has been referred to as augmentation and reduction,
outward and inward adaptation, forward and backward adaptation, as well
as potentiation and depression. Regardless of the terminology, the
systematic intrasaccadic perturbation is nevertheless designed to cause
either over-shooting or under-shooting of saccades relative to the
targets, and over the course of training, inducing hypometria or
hypermetria of saccades, even later, in the absence of further target
perturbations. Most saccadic adaptation research involves only one type,
but experiments comparing the two have found that saccadic augmentation
and reduction may involve distinct, or at least partially distinct,
mechanisms, exhibit different behavioural characteristics, and serve
somewhat different functions [@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008,
@Panouillères2009, @Panouillères2012].

[Distinct systems]Experiments that have examined both backward and
forward adaptation have found that backward adaptation is considerably
more robust, occurring in fewer trials, and is more reliable from person
to person [for a review, see @Hopp2004]. They also appear reflect
structurally unique systems. For instance, @Panouillères2009 adapted
participants either forward or backward, and had them perform
anti-saccades toward the adapted location. While most participants
adapted to their assigned conditions (5 of 19 in the forward condition
did not), only the backward adapted participants exhibited transfer to
anti-saccades. This hints that backward adaptation is occurring after
the mechanism required for saccade inversion, while forward adaptation
may not. Furthermore, @Panouillères2012 followed up with Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the lateral cerebellum during the
adaptation phase of both adaptive lengthening and shortening of
saccades. The result was a potentiation of adaptive lengthening, and and
a depression, and near elimination, of saccadic shortening, providing a
neuroanatomical disassociation between the two [@Panouillères2012] .
Cellular recording of primates seems to support this notion of divergent
neuroanatomy for the two types of adaptation. For instance, the
population response of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum seems to encode
or influence the duration of normal and gain-increased saccades, but not
gain-decreased saccades [@Catz2008].

[Why? Shortening is fatigue and may be special] There are a variety of
reasons for oculomotor systems to become more error-prone. One
particular, natural, cause, is both likely to be both ever-present and
unidirectional in the error it produces. Muscular fatigue is presumably
a major contributor to an organism's need for adaptive mechanisms.
Unlike, for example, damage to a particular muscle, or other
biomechanical changes, fatigue is always going to reduce saccadic
amplitude, regardless of the direction of the saccade. It stands to
reason that a "fatigue coping" system, because it is going to be
continually engaged, may be different in some ways than the mechanisms
for lengthening, or augmenting, saccades over time. In fact, its
possible that part or even all of saccadic reduction could be accounted
for by uncompensated fatigue. Backward perturbations remove the error
signal that engages anti-fatigue adaptation, and as a result, saccades
may shorten as a result of fatigue rather than any particular active
adaptive mechanisms. Beyond that, for whatever reason, normal saccades
are hypometric [@Wong2012]. As a result, backward adaptation is unique
in that occurs with target perturbations that either reduce the "error"
in foviating the target stimulus, or actually reverse the typical error
signal by producing an artificially hypermetric saccade.

[Vermal patients cant compensate for fatigue or adapt to SA] @Golla2008
tested controls and patients with cerebellar damage on a saccadic
adaptation task involving both augmented and shortened saccades. The
controls, and two patients with an intact oculomotor vermis, but large,
unilateral hemispheric lesions, adapted to the augmentation by
increasing saccade duration, but not peak velocity. They adapted to
inward adaptation, in a different manner by exhibiting changes both
parameters. In contrast, patients with damage to the oculomotor vermis
exhibited a complete extinction of outward adaptation, and a partial
loss of inward adaptation. Tellingly, they were also unable to reliably
saccade to un-perturbed targets over time as well. They exhibited a lack
of resilience when asked to saccade to fixed targets repeatedly. Their
saccades to these steady-state targets decreased in duration, producing
saccades which were more and more hypometric as the task went on
[@Golla2008] . This does not appear to the result of an unprocessed
error, as these poorer and poorer saccades were followed by a necissary
increase in corrective saccades [@Golla2008]. Instead, when taken
together, the selective, partial retention of inward adaptation and the
gradual shortening of saccades to static targets indicate that rather
than active adaptation, these participants are simply failing to
adequately compensate for fatigue of some sort.

Structure of an adaptive system 
-------------------------------

[Structure of SA comes heavily from animal studies]While variants of the
standard target-perturbation based paradigm are the base of research
investigating saccadic adaptation, much of the information about the
structural functionality maintaining saccadic accuracy come from the
effects of lesions or other neural dysfunction, and animal research.
Saccadic adaptation is an important low-level function of mammalian
visual systems, which all have imperfect ability to produce accurate
muscular torque over time, and imperfect perceptual abilities, so animal
research can provide a great deal of insight. Two approaches to study
saccadic adaptation in animals have typically been used. The more common
procedure of perturbing targets during the perceptual blindness of a
saccade, and the lesioning of extraocular muscles in monkeys
[@Optican1980; @Scudder1998].

### Cerebellum is key to maintaining reactive saccades {.western}

[Cerebellum=control] Saccadic adaptation is actually one of a set of
adaptation methodologies that has been central to understanding the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is a key area for movement control and
sensory-motor plasticity [@Glickstein2011]. A full analysis of what is
known about the neural substrates of saccadic adaptation in the
cerebellum would be beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, the
vast majority of neuroscience research investigating saccadic adaptation
has investigated, and in-fact implicated, structures in the cerebellum
as being either involved-in or directly responsible for the learning the
new oculomotor parameters. For more extensive reviews, see @Iwamoto2010
and @Pelisson2010.

[damage leads to loss of control] People with damage to the cerebellum
are typically characterized as having loss of movement coordination, or
"ataxia" of one movement type or another. A more nuanced view, though
reveals two very basic deficits. First, movement precision is poor, with
delayed and inappropriate corrections producing oscillations, or
"intention tremors", especially for multi-joint complex actions
[@Diedrichsen2013]. Secondly, and more directly relevant to the
discussion of saccadic adaptation, they typically fail to respond to
feedback like that of saccadic adaptation. The intention tremors seem to
be related to an ineffective or delayed use of sensory feedback, as it
is reduced or absent when patients point to targets with their eyes
closed [@Day1998].

[including in SA] Further, cerebellar damage seems to cause a variety of
oculomotor deficits, including dysmetria of saccadic eye movements, and
Nystagmus, an involuntary eye movement consisting of slow drift and fast
resetting phases, as well as an abnormal Vestibulo-ocular- reflex
[@Diedrichsen2013]. People with syndromes associated with cerebellar
dysfunction also show impaired saccadic adaptation [@Waespe1992].
Similarly, in monkeys, targeted damage to the cerebellum (Oculomotor
cerebellar vermis, fastigial nuclei) can nearly eliminate the ability to
adapt saccades [@Optican1980; @Goldberg1993; @Takagi1998; @Barash1999]

[Certain regions in particular] Medial, posterior, cerebellum (vermis
and fastigial nuclei) is thought to be central in the control of
accuracy and adaptive calibration of saccadic eye movements [for reviews
see: @Hopp2004, @Pélisson2003, @Pélisson2010]. For example, repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation of the medioposterior cerebellum has
been shown to produce an inhibitory effect on saccadic adaptation
[@Jenkinson2010]. Evidence for the role of other areas of the cerebellum
is much more sporadic and and difficult to glean a clear-cut role from.
Deficits of saccadic adaptation observed in humans with cerebellar
lesions suggest possible importance of lateral structures
[@Alahyane2008, @Choi2008, @Golla2008, Straube2001]. Some
electophysiological studies [@Mano1991, @Ron1973] and imaging studies
[@Dieterich2000, @Schraa-Tam2009] have hinted at other parts of the
cerebellum being involved in the control of saccades

[The Cerebellum is doing...] The cerebellum hints at a temptingly
universal function, occasionally affectionately referred to as the
cerebellar transform. It's recursive connectivity with motor, sensory
and other areas of the cortex as well as brainstem and direct spinal
pathways, as well as it's universal-seeming motor-refining abilities,
and uniform but modular histological structure, hint at a general
function applied to a wide range of motor actions. Unfortunately, the
exact nature of this "cerebellar transform" is a longstanding problem in
neuroscience, and goes far beyond what can be discussed here. In brief,
it may serve as a "predictive forward model" builder for motor control
[@Maill1998], or provide the input to build such models if they happen
to be located elsewhere in the cortex. Alternatively, the more classical
description of cerebellar function is that of error-based learning
[@Marr1969;@Albus1971] originally described a computational model of
error-based learning in the cerebellar cortex, and that idea of
error-based learning has been adopted as a central notion in research
into the cerebellum to date. Unfortunately, the Marr-Albus theories,
while recognizing the apparent need for an "error-signal" to drive
neuromotor learning, provide only a rudimentary idea of the type and
function of that error [see @Highstein2005 for a more recent
discussion]. The contemporary idea of error-based learning is based on
the comparison of predicted and actual sensory movement outcomes.
Crucially, it is the signed difference between those outcomes that is
capable of providing the impetus for a lasting parametric adaptation
[@Tseng2007].

[Not so simple] Cerebellar lesions can also effectively eliminate prism
adaptation, both in terms of corrections to movements while wearing
prisms, and any aftereffects [@Martin1996]. Similar results have been
found with adapting pointing movements to a force field or perturbations
produced by a robot arm [@Maschke2004;@Smith2005], gait adaptation to a
split-belt treadmill [@Morton2006], and reaching under novel visuomotor
transformations [@Tseng2007]. Saccadic adaptation is thus one of many
sensorimotor adaptations that seem to require the cerebellum
[@Golla2008, @Prsa2011]. However, even this finding may be influenced by
other oculomotor deficits. For example, some researchers have found
hypometria but unimpaired saccadic adaptation in patients with diffuse
cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar infarction [@Choi2008]. The picture is
likely far more complex than the cerebellum, and almost certainly
involves a complex interplay with other structures, like the superior
colliculus and cortical areas.

#### Cerebellar Vermis and lateral structures {.western}

[Cerebellar regions that contribute to SA]The cerebellum is far from a
homogeneous structure, and so considerable research has examined the
functional anatomy of cerebellar sub-structures. The cerebellar vermis,
and more specifically, the vermal lobuli VI and VII, commonly called the
posterior, or oculomotor vermis, is probably the best studied and well
known contributor to the control of saccadic eye movements. Purkinje
cells in this area are sensitive to eye position and, as a population,
encode saccade parameters like saccade timing and direction
[@Thier2002].

[medio-posterior cerebellum is primary candidate] There is substantial
support indicating that that the medio-posterior cerebellum, which
includes the above mentioned oculomotor vermis, plus the caudal part of
the fastigial nucleus, contributes to saccadic adaptation, or, at
minimum, backward adaptation of reactive saccades
[@HoppFuchs2004,@IwamotoKaku2010,@Pélisson2010,PrsaThier2011,Tian2009] .
For example, patients with lesions of the cerebellar vermis
[@Golla2008], or with a neurodegenerative disease which happens to
primarily damage the Purkinje cells of the vermis [@Xu-Wilson2009] are
unresponsive to backward saccadic adaptation. TODO: Further evidence
provided by [@Desmurget1998,@Jenkinson2010] if necissary.

[However, lateral areas may also play a part] It also requires
mentioning that there is some evidence of involvement of other parts of
the cerebellum in the adaptation of reactive saccades. @Panouillères2012
was able to modify reactive saccade adaptation with transcranial
magnetic stimulation of the hemispheric lobule Crus I. Others have found
further hints of hemispheric involvement
[@Alahyane2008,@Choi2008,@Straube2001,@Broekhoven2009].

[TMS of lat. cerebellum affects SA in complex ways] In order to
investigate the involvement of lateral cerebellum, @Panouillères2012
found that TMS over the human left Crus I of the cerebellum after
saccade detection had a dual effect on saccadic plasticity. Perhaps
paradoxically, after-effects indicated that it both reduced the
effectiveness of saccade-shortening adaptation (for saccades moving
contralateral to the stimulation), and augmented saccade-lengthening
adaptation (for saccades in both directions) [@Panouillères2012]. In
addition to affirming lateral cerebellum in saccadic adaptation, this
provides further evidence for distinct neural mechanisms of saccadic
depression and potentiation, and hints at an antagonistic relationship
between the two. Interestingly, the authors also found that TMS
immediately at saccade-onset, rather than after a delay, induced
hypometria in that same saccade, to a small degree, but consistently in
both directions. However, saccades with 30 or 60ms delayed TMS were not
measurably effected, however, all three conditions lead to the
after-effects described above [@Panouillères2012].

[Structure of Voluntary SA less studied] Much less work has been done
examining the neural substrates of the adaptation of volitional
saccades, despite the fact that these endogenous saccades are crucial
for day-to-day life. Earlier work seemed to indicate that cerebellar
lesions affected the accuracy of reactive saccades [@Straube1995], but a
more precise understanding probably comes from examining the particular
region of the cerebellum damaged. @Alahyane2008 examined deficits in two
individuals undergoing both reactive and voluntary adaptation after
isolated lesions in medial and lateral parts of the cerebellum. Saccadic
adaptation to contralesional targets was normal, however, aftereffects
post adaptation to ipsilesional targets depended on lesion location.
They found a double disassociation, where the medial lesion degraded
adaptation to reactive saccades, but left the voluntary saccade
adaptation unhindered, while the lateral lesion left reactive saccade
adaptation functioning normally, but degraded voluntary saccadic
adaptation [@Alahyane2008].

@Panouillères2013 examined the cerebellar substrates of adaptive
shortening by looking for disassociations between reactive and
volitional saccades among patients with damage to, or impaired input to
(because of Wallenberg Syndrome), regions of the cerebellum. In a study
of patients with cerebellar lesions, @Panouillères2013 found that while
damage to the medio-posterior cerebellum does not deferentially impair
either reactive or volitional saccades, damage to supero-anterior
regions showed specific deficits in the adaptation of voluntary
saccades[@Panouillères201].

[Not so clear, take care extrapolating reactive to voluntary] As with
the comparison of saccadic augmentation and reduction, the relationship
between the two types of saccades is far from clear, even in the case of
the cerebellar localization. Despite @Alahyane2008 finding a double
disassociation between medial and lateral cerebellar regions, others
have found evidence that both types of saccades activate hemispheric
lobules [@Gerardin2012]. Prudence is called for when comparing, or
attempting to extrapolate between reactive saccadic adaptation, and, for
example, voluntary scanning saccades.

FIXME: above is my terrible attempt to clarify the ambiguity involved in
using reactive saccadic adaptation with neglect patients, who exhibit
pathological scanning eye movements.

### Colliculus drives eye movements, but is outside adaptive mechanisms {.western}

[SC is central to saccades] Because saccades can be generated by
electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus [@Fitzgibbon1986], and
because it is well connected with both the oculomotor vermis and areas
of the cortex which seem related to eye movement control and saccadic
adaptation [@Johnston2008], the superior colliculus is a possible locus
of saccadic adaptation, or at minimum, a contributing player in a
network of structures performing the adaptation.

[but adapted parameter is post SC] If the adaptable "gain" parameter is
applied to saccadic movement execution after being generated in the
superior colliculus, then the relationship between this generated signal
and the actual saccadic magnitude should be modifiable with saccadic
adaptation. While early research involving stimulation of the DLSC of
the superior colliculus of monkeys failed to find any modulating effect
of saccade adaptation [@Fitzgibbon1986;@Melis1996], some researchers
have found indications of a connection [@Edelman2002]. @Edelman2002
found that they could modify electrically evoked movements with saccadic
adaptation if the electrical stimuli were very low current (near
threshold), and even then, only when the velocity of electrically evoked
saccades was similar to the visually guided saccades in the adaptation.
Nevertheless, the their success provides strong evidence that voluntary
saccades, at least, occur by adapting a parameter which is post-superior
colliculus. Further support comes from cell recordings of primate
collicular motor cells, which show a remarkable consistency in the face
of behavioural saccadic adaptation [@Frens1997], further supporting the
notion that parametric adaptation occurring downstream of the
colliculus.

### Cortical areas either contribute, or adapt in parallel {.western}

[Unlikely contributor to adaptation]While there is considerable evidence
that reactive saccades are driven dominantly by the superior colliculus,
and volitional saccades, a cortical-dominant system
[@Schiller1987;@Johnston2008;@Schraa-Tam2009;@Müri2008], saccadic
adaptation of the parameters of those saccades seems to occur at a
common stage [@Hopp2002]. This finding is problematic for the notion
that cortical areas may contribute to saccadic adaptation, as the
time-course for reactive saccadic adaptation seems to rule out very much
cortical involvement [@Hopp2002]. Nevertheless, there are some
suggestions that the cortex may play a part.

[parallel pathways hypothesis] @Melis1996 used a target-jump paradigm to
adaptively modify electrically stimulated saccades (superior
colliculus). After adaptation, only a partial transfer to visually
elicited saccades -indicating that some portion of the system was not
affected by the electrically stimulated saccades. The authors postulate
that both direct projections from both the frontal eye fields and
superior colliculus to a brainstem saccadic generator. These parallel
pathways are combined to produce parametric adaptation, and adaptation
of only a single pathway would be expected to produce only partial
adaptation of natural saccades.

FIXME: Above two paragraphs conflict. Clarify.

[Monkey/Human & 2-pathways aside] This theory also indicates caution
where generalizations from monkey research are required. The weightings
of the two parallel pathways are not likely to be completely identical
between species, and with the enlarged cortical areas of the human
brain, it seems probable that the relative contributions of the cortex
may also have been changed [@Fuchs1996;@Frens1994]. This is supported by
the fact that time course of adaptation is shorter in humans
[@Deubel1986; Frens1994] relative to monkeys [@Fuchs1996; Straube1997;
Scudder1998] . As with any field of research, it's debatable how much of
the monkey-human differences are due to unique neural functionality, and
how much is due simply to experimental design differences required by
the different capabilities of the subjects.

FIXME: above paragraph unnecessary.

### Locus of adaptation {.western}

Examining the particularities of saccadic adaptation and the neural
functionality of saccades are deeply intertwined. Most of the
behavioural and psychophysical evidence discussed in earlier sections
here provide clues about where in the perception and action systems the
adaptation may be occurring. More specifically, though, we are able to
glean an estimate of the earliest stages of vision, and the latest
stages of perception and action systems that are involved in saccadic
adaptation, providing a rough outline of the functional anatomy.

[Adaptation common between volitional and adaptive] @Hopp2002
behaviourally adapted participants to either voluntary or reactive
saccades and found that to the extent that participants retained the
adaptation to the trained type, it transferred equally to the other.
This provides evidence supporting the notion that, despite the two types
of *saccades* involving different functional systems, *adaptation* is
probably happening at a shared point, like the brainstem or cerebellum,
rather than, for example, a cortical area. This result was supported in
a more recent replication that found transfer between the two types of
adapted saccades, but no mutual transfer to or from adapted
memory-guided saccades [saccades to remembered target locations;
@Hopp2010].

[or, at least, overlapping] @Alahyane2007 also examined the mutual
transfer of reactive and voluntary saccades, and while they also found
bidirectional transfer of adaptation, it was much less than 100% in the
specific case of transfer from reactive to voluntary saccades. This
asymmetrical transfer lead them to suggest that adaptation of the two
types is at least partially distinct, perhaps involving common brainstem
and different, or overlapping, cerebellar regions [@Alahyane2007].
