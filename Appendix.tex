\caption{Figure depicts four trials selected to depict typical
examples which do not meet the inclusion criteria in Chapter 4. A) Gaps
in sample data make analysis imprecise. B and C) Trials with three or more saccades
are often unclear as to which is the primary saccade between targets or may include
distraction events. D) large amounts of movement which does not meet saccade 
threshold often indicates drift caused by partial pupil occlusion by eyelids}
