\caption{Figure depicts four trials selected to depict typical
examples which do not meet the inclusion criteria in Chapter 4. A) Gaps
in sample data make analysis imprecise. B and C) Trials with three or more saccades
are often unclear as to which is the primary saccade between targets or may include
distraction events or non-ballistic eye movement. 
D) large amounts of movement which does not meet saccade 
threshold often indicates drift caused by partial pupil occlusion by eyelids}
