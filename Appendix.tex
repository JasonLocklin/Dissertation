\caption{Four exemplar trials included in the analysis. Trials meet inclusion
criteria outlined in Chapter 4. In particular, a clear first saccade is present
in each case, with a clear indication of saccade end-point.}

\caption{Four exemplar trials discarded from the analysis. Trials do not meet
inclusion criteria outlined in Chapter 4. From left to right: (1) gaps in sample
data make analysis unreliable, (2 and 3) more than two saccades indicate possible distraction
or non-ballistic movement to target 2, and (4) large amount of eye position drift
during fixation make saccade detection unreliable.}
