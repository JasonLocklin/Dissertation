Notes for 5 minute Thesis
========================

##  Overall message:
Unilateral neglect is a complex deficit involving not just an inability to attend to objects in the neglected field, but also seems to include spatial and temporal deficits in the perception of non-neglected stimuli. For example, searching for and failing to find objects in non-neglected space, difficulties recalling the locations or identities of non-neglected objects for even a short time, and an inability to accurately estimate time intervals.

My work attempts to address clarify these deficits of non-neglected space, and how they relate to the perceptual biases inherent in the disorder.

### Data on VWM, & covert attention


![VWM and Covert Attention Task]()

Detailed analysis has not been completed yet. However, this figure shows a simple measure of performance comparing healthy controls and neglect patients. Probability distributions were calculated based on a guess, a correct target identification and distractor identitites. Plotted here is the probability that the response was based on a correct memory of the target colour. Importantly, this task **can** be used to examine whether it was the spatial position of the target or the identity (colour) of the target that was lost. 
![Simple Performance of Patients and Controls]()

A covert orienting task performed with these same subjects, with either a brief (50ms) or typical SOA (150ms; cue remains on screen). Predictably, performance on trials with left-space targets was poor, often failing to respond on any trials, but what is interesting are the trials with right targets. While the neglect group performed slower accross the board in every condition, right valid targets -that is, when both cue and target are in the non-neglected field, actually produced a 3-5x larger magnitude cuing effect in the neglect group. In fact, while the effect of validity produced mixed results, both types of cued trial resulted in consistantly faster response times than uncued trials in almost all cases.

### Prisms, SWM, and TE.
The visualmotor adaptation that comes with using one's hands while wearing rightward shifting prisms has been long shown to effect the degree of spatial neglect. That is to say, after removing the prisms, neglect patients show improved ability to reach for a center of mass (line bisection), and voluntarily scan a more centralized field when looking around (eye movements during visual search). There has been indications, however, that these changes do not effect perceptual bias (visual search performance, and LT).

We found that Prisms also fail to remediate rather large SWM and TE deficits when the task occurs entirely in their non-neglected field.

### SA and LB/LT
Previous research has shown Prisms effect LB, but not LT. This indicates eye-hand visuomotor adaptation, but not perceptual effects (congruent with reports from clinical applications?). Are we just changing where people point? 

Interestingly, SA, unlike prisms has been shown to produce perceptual effects in healthies, but does not involve the eye-hand visuomotor training that prism adaptation does.  If perceptual effects carry over to patient, we have a tool to compare changes in perceptual biases across the other deficits. LB effects tell us about the generalizability of visualmotor adaptation in neglect.
