Chronological Notebook
======================

This branch is for completing the review paper for a reading course with James. The branch will either be renamed, or a new one created
with a more descriptive name for preparing the paper for publication.

Below is a chronological notebook/scratch pad. 

### September 19, 2013
Literature created in Zotero under "Reading Course." I'll periodically export the collection in the folder 'bib' here. I'm not sure what software I will use to write this up with for now, so the 'bib' folder may end up with the list in a couple formats. 

Right now I need to come up with a concrete topic to talk to James about, so I'm just surveying the S.A. lit that I already have.

### October 05, 2013
James want's the more general topic of  "Saccadic adaptation influences on perception." I am still looking for as much clinically relevant studies like the VSS poster I emailed David Pelisson about. 
This branch is issue #2.
For an outline of of this paper, see 'outline.m'. 

### October 17, 2013 
Organized all S.A. papers into subfolders of the Zotero library. Folders are numbered to match sections in outline. Worked on populating outline with topics and suggested articles for those topics. Up to "Cerebellum" in zotero library.
