Chronological Notebook
======================

This branch is for completing the review paper for a reading course
with James. The branch will either be renamed, or a new one created
with a more descriptive name for preparing the paper for publication.

Below is a chronological notebook/scratch pad. 

### September 19, 2013
Literature created in Zotero under "Reading Course." I'll periodically
export the collection in the folder 'bib' here. I'm not sure what
software I will use to write this up with for now, so the 'bib' folder
may end up with the list in a couple formats. 

Right now I need to come up with a concrete topic to talk to James
about, so I'm just surveying the S.A. lit that I already have.

### October 05, 2013
James want's the more general topic of "Saccadic adaptation influences
on perception." I am still looking for as much clinically relevant
studies like the VSS poster I emailed David Pelisson about. 

This branch is issue #2.
For an outline of of this paper, see 'outline.m'. 

### October 17, 2013 
Organized all S.A. papers into subfolders of the Zotero library.
Folders are numbered to match sections in outline. Worked on
populating outline with topics and suggested articles for those
topics. Up to "Cerebellum" in zotero library.

## January 15, 2014 
Meeting with James to start reading course.

Cleaning up outline. ~~Will probably have to condense the functional
basis of SA section~~ (James wanted to keep the breadth here). This
will be the intro to my SA chapter(s), so the theme should be the
justification for doing SA with hemineglect.

Keep the clinical papers brief. The justification should centre more 
around 

## January 20, 2014 
TODO (short term):

Minor stuff:
* Reorganize task list for new defence date.
* Figure out Committee
* Get that poster from Pelisson's student.

Angle 1:
* Figure out what happened in the normative SA data.
* Tweak SA task for patient.
* Organize a pre-test with Nadine of a patent, and then bring them in.

Angle 2:
* Finish identifying papers for reading course outline.
* Write paper.
* Paper outline may have content that can be moved to CH4 intro. 

Today, started organizing myself re normative SA data. 

## February 13, 2014
CNS Brownbag in 11 days. Origionally planned on getting Neglect 
participant data collected for it, but it's too late now. 


## 13.08.2014
Working offline at cottage. When in town, online, do the following in order:

- Get ipad to download attachments from zotero
- Pull updates to notes.md and outline.md from work computer
X Fix netbook zotero to sync over webdav.
X proxy or ssh-vpn to U.W.
X get as many pdfs from the SA collection into zotero as possible, 
starting with the lesion studies.
