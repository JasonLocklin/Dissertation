The data file I recieved is a complicated excel file with lots of information. I
reduced it to a simple table manually and saved to a csv file for reading into 
R. 

```{r}
vwm <- read.csv("Data/vwm_data.csv", 
                colClasses=c("factor","factor", rep("numeric", 12)))
```


The data needs to be tidied to a convenient format (see Wickham, 2014).

```{r}
library(reshape2)
d <- melt(vwm, id.vars=c("Subj_Group", "Subj_ID"))
d = data.frame(c(d[1:2], colsplit(d$variable, "_item[s]?.", c("Number_of_Items","variable")), d[4]))
head(d)
```


A quick summary of the data for each group.
```{r}
acast(d, Subj_Group ~ variable ~ Number_of_Items , fun=mean)
```

Sanity check:

1. Looking at precision, Patients generally do worse than Older Controls, who
generally do worse than Young adults. Each group generally does worse as more 
targets are added.

2. pTarget: Patents are averaging lower probabilities of selecting the target 
color even in the case of no distractors. Distractors may be effective in the 
healthy groups, but they do quite well.

3. The healthy groups seem to rarely select a distractor color, and seem to be 
guessing when they get it wrong. The Patients might be selecting distractor 
colors as often as they guess, indicating a possible lack of binding color to 
spatial location.
