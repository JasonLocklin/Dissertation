### Visual Working Memory

#### Response Precision

Response precision was compared between
the three groups and three conditions using a mixed between and
within-measures
ANOVA (Figure \ref{fig_VWM_Precision}). Response precision was
positively skewed, but was sufficiently normal when log
transformed (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk $w=0.98$, $p=0.9$). While there
was a significant effect of the number of squares condition
($F(2,44) = 14.7$, $\text{p} < 0.001$), the effect of group did
not reach significance
($F(2,22) = 3.19$, $\text{p} = 0.06$). The interaction between the
two was also non-significant
($F(4,44) = 0.88$, $\text{p} = 0.4$). *Post hoc* multiple
comparisons, using Tukey's HSD, indicated that the above, near-significant,
group effect was the driven by a possible age effect between young
adults and patients
($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}} = 0.6$, $\text{p} = 0.05$). While
the other age-related contrast was not significant
(i.e., young adult and older control groups,
$\overline{M}_{\text{diff}} = 0.4$, $\text{p} = 0.3$), the
critical comparison, between patients and older controls, did
not demonstrate an effect of neurological damage on
response precision
($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}} = -0.23$, $\text{p} = 0.6$).

#### Single Square Condition

When considering response probabilities, the single square
condition of the VWM task was analyzed
separately, as it represents an arguably distinct challenge to
participants, and the outcome variables are different
when compared with trials that contain non-target distractors
(i.e., the single square condition
lacks a $P_{NT}$ measure). It does not require the participant to
encode distinct spatial locations, or to bind colour and spatial
location, so it is more purely a measure of an individual's ability
to precisely encode and recall a target colour.

[pTarget] Because the single square condition has no non-targets,
and therefore no $P_{NT}$ (i.e., $P_{T} = (1 - P_{G})$), there is
effectively only one dependent variable and the choice of which
probability to use for analysis is arbitrary. For convenience,
$P_{T}$ is used here as the dependant variable. As can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig_VWM_1Target}, the two healthy groups perform
nearly perfectly by this metric. A one-way ANOVA containing all
three group means was significant ($F(2) = 38$, $\text{p} <
0.001$).  Tukey's HSD tests were performed to compare the means, and
the two healthy groups, who appear to have been performing at
ceiling, did not differ on this metric
($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}}  = 0.02$, $\text{p} = 0.56$).
However, the patients performed significantly worse than both
young adults and older controls ($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}}
= 0.17$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, and, $\overline{M}_{\text{diff}} =
0.19$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, respectively).

the probability of guessing, so higher values are more accurate).

#### Two and Three Square Conditions

[Approach] In the multi-square conditions, three outcome
probability estimates were produced. As was the case for the one
square condition, these probability estimates sum to one, and as
such represent only two unique values. Here, two types of failures
were chosen for the analysis --- the probability of guessing
($P_{G}$), and the probability of indicating a non-target distractor
($P_{NT}$; Figure \ref{fig_VWM_MTarget})

The two dependant variables were analyzed
separately, rather than in a multivariate analysis, as the
characteristics of the data violate many of the assumptions of
standard multivariate tests and the limited sample size would
render any result tenuous at best.  This limits the ability to
compare the two outcomes, but provides clearer answers to the
distinct questions each measure addresses.

The restricted range of both probability scores, and high
frequency of near-zero outcomes produced a highly skewed and
non-normal distribution that could not be normalized. As a result,
the results of the 2 and 3 target conditions were collapsed, and
analysis was performed with non-parametric tests.

#### Guessing

[Guessing 2] The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for the
non-parametric omnibus model of $P_G$, and it did not indicate
differences between groups ($\chi^2(2) = 2.89$, $\text{p} = 0.2$).
Non-parametric
relative effects using Tukey contrasts were performed in a
"one-sided" fashion, assuming age and injury would only impair
performance [Using Nparcomp, @nparcomp].
The Patients did not significantly differ from
either the young adults ($t(8) = 2.20$, $\text{p} = 0.08$), nor
older controls ($t(8) = 0.19$, $\text{p} = 0.8$). Additionally,
the two healthy groups did not differ from one another ($t(8) =
0.86$, $\text{p} = 0.5$).

#### Non-target Selection

[Non-target/binding errors] As was done for the guessing data,
analysis was performed on the collapsed means of the two
and three target trials.
Here, however, the Kruskal-Wallis omnibus test was significant
($\chi^2(2) = 7.5$, $\text{p} < 0.05$).  Multiple comparison tests
yielded significant differences between the patients and the two
healthy groups ($t(12) = 2.47$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, for older
controls, and $t(8) = 3.9$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, or young adults).
The two healthy groups, however, did not significantly differ from one
another ($t(8) = 0.54$, $\text{p} = 0.6$).

While the groups did not differ statistically when guessing,
patients selected non-target colours more frequently than the two
healthy groups.}

### Covert Orienting Task

Analysis of the covert orienting data was limited given that
three of the patients failed to respond to any left-sided
targets (note: these patients also presented with the most severe
neglect symptoms).
Leftward cue-effect sizes (CES) were calculated for each
participant in the patient group and older controls. Overall, both
groups exhibited significant cue effects, indicating significant
cost for reorienting attention to invalidly cued targets ($t(4) =
2.16$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, for the patients, and $t(7) = 2.48$,
$\text{p} < 0.05$ for the older controls). To examine group
differences in covert orienting, a mixed ANOVA was performed with
group as the between-subjects factor and SOA as the
within-subjects factor. An effect of group approached significance
($F(1) = 3.7$, $\text{p} = 0.08$), while SOA and the interaction
were non-significant ($F(1) = 0.5$, $\text{p} = 0.49$, and $F(1) =
0.02$, $\text{p} = 0.8$, respectively). Considering the size of the patient
group in this analysis ($n=5$), it is unlikely that the sample variance
provides a good estimate of the population, so the groups were
also compared using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test,
collapsing across SOA, and this did indicate that patients
exhibited larger leftward CES than the older controls
($\chi^2(2) = 4.2$, $\text{p} < 0.05$).


[Compare directly to normative data] Figure \ref{fig_COVAT}
depicts the CES of the 5 patients over the range of
performance observed in the healthy controls (bands represent 1
and 2 standard deviations).  As can be seen in the figure, three
of the patients performed within the range of healthy
controls.  In contrast, two other patients demonstrated
leftward CESs that were well outside the range of the healthy
older controls. It is also worth noting that one of the two,
Patient 171, did not show any signs of neglect on the clinical
tests, and the other, Patient 454, exhibited moderately
neglecting symptoms when compared with their cohort. This patient
(454) produced a bisection bias above our threshold, though only
at 6\%, a near median performance for the group, and produced
errors in figure copying, but did not miss any left-sided targets
in the star cancellation test. It also should be noted that Patient 171 did
not show a similarly large rightward CES, so it cannot be said
that the result was a deficit of general covert re-orienting, but,
indeed, reflects a lateralized deficit ($CES_R$ of -22 and 11 for 50 and
150ms SOA respectively). For Patient 454, it was less clear
($CES_R$ of -263 and -21 for 50 and 150ms SOA respectively;
negative values indicate faster invalid trials).

older controls.}

### Comparing Visual Working Memory and Covert Orienting

#### Group Level Comparison

In order to explore the relationship between visual working
memory and covert orienting, a generalized linear model was fit
predicting group affiliation based on the
demonstrated deficits from the two tasks.
Specifically, a logistic regression was computed based on
predicting group with just CES in an initial model, and then
sequentially adding the
two visual working memory deficits ($P_G$ from the
single target condition, and $P_{NT}$) in a second and third step. This order was
chosen in order to examine visual working memory as a predictor
of the patient group beyond (i.e., partialled on) the attentional
deficits measured with the covert orienting task. In order to
model the complete data set of 8 patients, values of 2 standard deviations
greater than the group mean were substituted for the three patients who
failed to orient leftward
(i.e., the data was Winsorized).
This procedure emphasizes any contribution of CES, at the risk
of over-emphasizing it, and in doing so, makes later estimates of
visual working memory contributions more conservative.

Because $P_{NT}$ and $P_G$ could not be normalized, each was transformed
via a median split into categorical factors representing "good"
and "poor" performance. The analysis of deviance indicated that
CES, on it's own, significantly predicted group affiliation (see
Table \ref{aod}). The addition of $P_{NT}$ was not significant, but $P_G$ did
significantly describe group, when partialled on both CES and
$P_{NT}$.  No interactions were significant.

#### Individual Patient Comparison
When comparing patients on a case by case basis, they can be
divided into 3 groups based on covert orienting results;
non-responders (3), large deficit (2), and near normal range CES (3).
The three non-responders were the most densely neglecting patients
on the clinical tests, and demonstrated strong deficits on the
visual working memory task.  This was particularly apparent in the
measure of non-target selection, where these three performed
considerably worse than the rest of the group (Table
\ref{tbl_VWM}).

The two patients exhibiting a large deficit on CES
did not stand out with similarly extreme performance
deficits on the visual working memory task. When the two are compared with
the three normal range CES patients, as can be observed in Table
\ref{tbl_VWM}, Patient 454 performed slightly worse than the median on
both visual working memory measures, while Patient 171, who,
as mentioned previously, as the only one in the group to score negatively on
all three clinical measures of neglect, was actually the most
accurate participant. Similarly, the near normal range CES
patients did not stand out as different from their cohort on
either visual working memory deficit.
