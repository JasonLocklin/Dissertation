### Visual Working Memory

#### Single Square Condition

The single square condition of the VWM task was analyzed
separately as it represents an arguably distinct challenge to
participants, and the outcome variables are different (i.e., it
lacks a $P_{NT}$ measure) when compared with trials that contain
non-target distractors. It does not require the participant to
encode spatial location, or any binding of colour and spatial
location, so it is more purely a measure of the person's ability
to precisely encode and recall a target colour.

[Response Precision] Response precision for the single square 
condition was compared between the three groups using a one-way
ANOVA (figure \ref{fig_VWM_Precision}).  There were no significant
differences between the group means, despite an apparent advantage
for the young controls (one way: $F(2,22)= 1.50$, $\text{p}=0.2$).
It is also worth noting that all of the patients responded within
the range of performance observed in the two control groups.

of the response distribution, so higher values indicate better
performance).  The groups do not statistically differ in their
ability to manually indicate their response precisely.}

\end{figure}

[pTarget] Because the single square condition has no non-targets,
and therefore no $P_{NT}$ (i.e., $P_{T} = (1 - P_{G})$), there is
effectively only one dependent variable and the choice of which
probability to use for analysis is arbitrary. For convenience,
$P_{G}$ is used here as the dependant variable. As can be seen in
figure \ref{fig_VWM_1Target}, the two healthy groups perform
nearly perfectly by this metric. A one-way ANOVA containing all
three group means was significant ($F(2) = 38$, $\text{p} <
0.001$).  Tukey HSD tests were performed to compare the means, and
the two healthy groups, who appear to have been performing at
ceiling, are not shown to be different
($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}}  = 0.02$, $\text{p} = 0.56$).
However, both young adults and the older control group were
significantly different from patients ($\overline{M}_{\text{diff}}
= 0.17$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, and, $\overline{M}_{\text{diff}} =
0.19$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, respectively).

selection for the single square condition (i.e., the inverse of

ceiling, with the patient group responding less reliably.}

#### Two and Three Square Conditions

[Approach] In the multi-square conditions, three outcome
probability estimates were produced. As was the case for the one
square condition, these probability estimates sum to one, and as
such represent only two unique values. Here, two types of failures
were chosen for the analysis (the probability of guessing,
$P_{G}$, and the probability of indicating a non-target distractor
($P_{NT}$)).  The two dependant variables were analyzed
separately, rather than in a multivariate analysis, as the
characteristics of the data violate many of the assumptions of
standard multivariate tests and the limited sample size would
render any result tenuous at best.  This limits the ability to
compare the two outcomes, but provides clearer answers to the
distinct questions each measure addresses.

[Guessing 1] Guessing measures the tendency to indicate a colour
that was not represented in any of the distributions (see
figure a).  The restricted range of probability scores, and high
frequency of near-zero outcomes produced a highly skewed and
non-normal distribution that even with data transformations, was
not sufficiently normal for parametric analysis to be appropriate.
The means of the three groups and two square conditions can be
seen in figure \ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}. As an attempt to analyze the
data, the two square conditions were collapsed to produce means
for a more generic "multi-square" performance metric.



[Guessing 2] The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for the
non-parametric omnibus model of $P_G$, and it did not indicate
differences ($\chi^2(2) = 2.89$, $\text{p} = 0.2$). Non-parametric
relative effects using Tukey contrasts were performed in a
"one-sided" fashion, assuming age and injury would only impair
performance.  The Patients did not significantly differ from
either the young adults ($t(8) = 2.20$, $\text{p} = 0.08$), or
older controls ($t(8) = 0.19$, $\text{p} = 0.8$). Additionally,
the two healthy groups did not differ from one another ($t(8) =
0.86$, $\text{p} = 0.5$).  [Footnote: Parametric tests were also
performed using a square-root transform of the data and yielded
the same results.]

[Non-target/binding errors] As was the case for the $P_G$, the
$P_{NT}$ data is highly non-normal and transformations are
ineffective in correcting for the nature of the data. Figure
\ref{fig_VWM_MTarget} presents the means for the two multi-square
conditions. As was done for the guessing data,
analysis was performed on the collapsed means of the two
conditions. Here, however, the Kruskal-Wallis test was significant
($\chi^2(2) = 7.5$, $\text{p} < 0.05$).  Multiple comparison tests
yielded significant differences between the patients and the two
healthy groups ($t(12) = 2.47$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, for older
controls, and $t(8) = 3.9$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, or young adults).
The two healthy groups did not significantly differ from one
another ($t(8) = 0.54$, $\text{p} = 0.6$).

While the groups did not differ statistically when guessing,
patients selected non-target colours more frequently than the two
healthy groups.}

### Covert Orienting Task

Analysis of the covert orienting data was extremely limited given
that 3 of the 8 patients failed to respond to any left-sided
targets. Not only does this prevent any measure of leftward
orienting deficits in almost half the sample, but those three
participants also exhibited the strongest symptoms of neglect on
the clinical measures. This means that not only is the statistical
power of any analysis substantially reduced, but that analysis
will necessarily be performed only on moderately neglecting
participants. 


Leftward cue-effect sizes (CES) were calculated for each
participant in the patient group and older controls. Overall, both
groups exhibited significant cue effects, indicating significant
cost for reorienting attention to invalidly cued targets ($t(4) =
2.16$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, for the patients, and $t(7) = 2.48$,
$\text{p} < 0.05$ for the older controls). To examine group
differences in covert orienting, a mixed Anova was performed with
group as the between-subjects factor and SOA as the
within-subjects factor. An effect of group approached significance
($F(1) = 3.7$, $\text{p} = 0.08$), while SOA and the interaction
were non-significant ($F(1) = 0.5$, $\text{p} = 0.49$, and $F(1) =
0.02$, $\text{p} = 0.8$).

[Compare directly to normative data] Figure \ref{fig_COVAT}
depicts the CES of the 5 neglect participants over the range of
performance observed in the healthy controls (bands represent 1
and 2 standard deviations).  As can be seen in the figure, three
of the patients performed well within the range of healthy
controls.  In contrast, the final two patients demonstrated
leftward CESs that were well outside the range of the healthy
older controls. It is also worth noting that one of the two,
Patient 171, did not show any signs of neglect on the clinical
tests, and the other, Patient 454, exhibited only weakly
neglecting symptoms when compared with their cohort. This patient
(454) produced a bisection bias above our threshold, though only
at 6\%, a near median performance for the group, and produced
errors in figure copying, but did not miss any left-sided targets
in the stars test. It also should be noted that Patient 171 did
not show similarly large rightward CE sizes, so it cannot be said
that the result was a deficit of general covert re-orienting, but,
indeed, a lateralized deficit ($CES_R$ of -22 and 11 for 50 and
150ms SOA respectively). For Patient 454, it was less clear
($CES_R$ of -263 and -21 for 50 and 150ms SOA respectively;
negative values indicate faster invalid trials).

\caption{Figure depicts left CES of each of the 5 patients that
were able to perform the COVAT.  Larger values indicate difficulty
re-orienting leftward after a rightward attentional cue. Dark and
lighter horizontal bands are overlaid that indicate 1 and 2
standard deviations around the mean normative performance of the
older controls.}

### Comparing Visual Working Memory and Covert Orienting 

The reduced group size, as a result of the inability of three
patients to orient to leftward targets, prevents reliable
statistical analysis of the relationship between the covert
orienting and visual working memory tasks. The two patients that
performed well outside the range of healthy performance on the
covert orienting task did not stand out with extreme performance
deficits on the visual working memory task. When compared with the
rest of the neglecting group, as can be observed in table
\ref{tbl_VWM}, Patient 454 performed slightly worse than the median on
both visual working memory measures, while Patient 171, who,
incidentally was the only one in the group to score negatively on
all three clinical measures of neglect, was actually the most
accurate participant, again, on both measures. This lack of
reliably similar performance between the two tasks hints at the
decoupled nature of the two domains suggested earlier. However, of
note, the three most densely neglecting patients on the clinical
tests, who were the same three patients unable to complete the
covert orienting task, demonstrated strong deficits on the visual
working memory task.  This was particularly apparent in the
measure of non-target selection, where these three performed
considerably poorer than the rest of the group (See table
\ref{tbl_VWM}).
