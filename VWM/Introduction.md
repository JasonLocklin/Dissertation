Exploring the relationship between visual working memory and attentionin neglect.
==================================================================================

As already discussed, most of the traditional models of neglect describe
the disorder as a deficit of spatial attention. A disorder driven by a
disengagement deficit, or difficulty with disengaging attention away
from right-space stimuli [Posner1984], an attentional ‘stickiness’ that
results from disruption to inferior parietal cortex - a region known to
be important for effective attentional disengagement and re-orienting
[@Corbetta2002]. This anchoring of neglect as an attentional disorder,
however, colours performance deficits observed with other tasks. Tasks
which are not direct measures of attention, and for which performance
may be degraded for other reasons. For example, lateralized performance
on object cancellation tasks could be couched as an effect of the
spatial attention deficit, however, the revisiting behaviours observed
on the "good" side [@Husain2001,@Patron2006] may indicate something more
nuanced is occurring. Even eliminating targets as they are cancelled,
thereby removing their potential to capture attention, improves but does
not fully remediate neglect performance on the task [@Mark2012]. 

In fact, a great deal of research over the past few decades has
highlighted aspects of neglect that clearly go beyond spatially
lateralized deficits of attention. For example, neglect patients tend to
have difficulties with sustained attention [@Robertson1995], even when
operating in a non-spatial modality [@Roberson1997]. The attentional
blink, a measure of temporal, selective attention is exaggerated in
neglect. When presented with a rapid series of stimuli with two embedded
targets sparated by varying temporal intervals, neglect patients require
up to three times as much time between them in order to identify both
correctly [@Husain1997]. In addition to these non-lateralized attention
deficits, recent work has highlighted deficits of spatial working memory
for stimuli in central or right, putatively non-neglected space
[@Husain2001,@Danckert2006,@Malhotra2005,@Striemer2013].

Non-lateralized selective attention and sustained attention are strongly
correlated with both neglect severity, and recovery over time
[@Husain2003]. Further, remediation of these non-spatial deficits can
improve spatial neglect symptoms [@Robertson1995]. This has lead some to
go so far as to speculate that the non-spatial deficits are the driving
factor behind the persistence and clinical relevance of neglect
[@Husain2003]. In other words, a bias in spatial attention is overcome
by the brain's adaptive mechanisms, *unless* it is accompanied by other
deficits of attentional deployment that prevent the brain from
recognizing the errors. More conservatively, these recent discoveries
indicate that, despite the fact that lateralized attentional deficits
seem to represent a cornerstone feature of the neglect syndrome, they,
alone, fail to compose a complete picture of the disorder.

Furthermore, recent attempts at rehabilitating neglect have shown that
while spatial attention can be improved, a range of perceptual biases
remain unaltered. As noted earlier, several aversive and invasive
treatments intended to trigger attentional re-orienting to left space
have been tried, with little clinical effectiveness. The most promising
treatment has been prism adaptation, because it is non-aversive, and
because it has been shown to produce effects lasting much longer than
the treatment duration [tk]. Unfortunately, while prism adaptation
produces striking changes in spatial attention [tk], there is a small,
but increasing set of neglect deficits that are not improved [tk]. Many
of these could be described as perceptual tasks, like deficits on the
landmark task [tk], and facial-emotion judgment [tk]. It may be the case
then that prisms operate on neural systems important for the deployment
of attention, but have little to no effect on those mechanisms needed to
form accurate perceptual representations.

Part of the deficit involved in maintaining accurate perceptual
representations may be driven by working memory impairments. As
mentioned earlier, neglect patients have deficits of spatial working
memory, even in "non-neglected" right or central space [tk].

In this context, it's important to consider the relationship between
spatial working memory and spatial attention. The two systems appear to
be independent and functionally unique, generally residing in ventral
and dorsal visual systems, respectively, although there is some
functional overlap and mutual interaction [@Awh2001]. Specifically, in
healthy people, mechanisms of spatial attention provide a rehearsal-like
function to maintain information held in working memory [@Awh2001]. This
arguably creates three possible causes of the working memory problems in
neglect. First, they could be a direct result of spatial attention
deficits. This seems less-likely as patients maintain the ability to
orient to rightward and central targets effectively, however, we can not
rule out the possibility that subtle pathological orienting deficits
exist for central and right space that in turn impact upon WM. If this
was the case, though, we might expect perceptual deficits to improve
along with attention deficits and this does not appear to be the case
[tk]. Second, the ability to utilize spatial attention for rehearsal may
be disrupted in neglect by a dorsal-ventral disconnect arising from the
neglect-inducing lesion. This would imply that ventral processing may
not be directly impaired in neglect, but that the spatial working memory
deficit comes from the ventral system's inability to recruit attentional
mechanisms to support rehearsal processes [tk Awh]. Third, the working
memory deficits may be independent of the spatial attention deficits. To
test this possibility, a new version of the working memory task was
created to minimize the possible reliance on spatial attention rehearsal
mechanisms. Rather than asking participants to remember and recall the
spatial locations of targets, memory for target colour was tested.
Placing the primary requirement of the task on colour processing
dramatically reduced reliance on spatial attention and placed any
rehearsal mechanism requirements within the ventral stream, eliminating
the likelihood that the measured deficits would be the result of the
hypothesized disconnection between the dorsal and ventral streams. If
attention and working memory deficits are indeed independent in neglect,
then deficits of a similar degree of severity would be expected on this
task as have been seen in past research employing a purely spatial WM
task. That is, WM deficits will be evident even when the involvement of
spatial attention is low.
