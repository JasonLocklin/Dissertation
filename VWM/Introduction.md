Exploring the relationship between visual working memory and attention in neglect.
==================================================================================

As discussed earlier, most traditional models of neglect describe the
disorder as a deficit of spatial attention. A disorder driven by a
difficulty in disengaging attention away from right-space stimuli
[@Posner1984], an attentional ‘stickiness’ that results from
disruption to inferior parietal cortex --- a region known to be
important for effective attentional disengagement and re-orienting
[@Corbetta2002]. This perhaps oversimplification of neglect as an attentional
disorder, however, colours interpretation of deficits observed with
other tasks --- Tasks which are not direct measures of attention,
and for which performance may be degraded for other reasons. For
example, lateralized failures on object cancellation tasks (i.e.,
omissions of left-sided targets) could be couched as a consequence
of a spatial attention deficit. However, revisiting behaviour
(i.e., re-cancelling old targets as if they were new), commonly
observed on the non-neglected, "good" side [@Husain2001;
@Parton2006], suggest something more nuanced is occurring. Even
eliminating targets as they are cancelled, thereby removing their
potential to re-capture attention, improves but does not fully
remediate revisiting behaviour on the task [@Mark1988]. 

In fact, a great deal of research over the past few decades has
highlighted aspects of neglect that clearly go beyond spatially
lateralized deficits of attention. For example, neglect patients
tend to have difficulties with sustained attention
[@Robertson1995], even when operating in a non-spatial modality
[@Robertson1997]. For example, the attentional blink --- a measure of temporal,
selective attention --- is exaggerated in neglect. When presented with
a rapid series of stimuli with two embedded targets separated by
varying temporal intervals, neglect patients require up to three
times as much time between targets in order to identify both
correctly [@Husain1997]. In addition to these non-lateralized
attention deficits, recent work has highlighted deficits of
spatial working memory for stimuli in central or right, putatively
non-neglected space [@Husain2001; @Danckert2006; @Malhotra2005;
@Striemer2013].

Non-lateralized selective attention, and sustained attention, are
strongly correlated with both neglect severity and recovery over
time [@Husain2003]. Further, remediation of these non-spatial
deficits can improve spatial neglect symptoms [@Robertson1995].
This has lead some to go so far as to speculate that the
non-spatial deficits are the driving factor behind the persistence
and clinical relevance of neglect [@Husain2003]. In other words, a
bias in spatial attention is overcome by the brain's adaptive
mechanisms, *unless* it is accompanied by other deficits of
attentional deployment that prevent the brain from recognizing the
errors.  More conservatively, these recent discoveries indicate
that, despite the fact that lateralized attentional deficits seem
to represent a cornerstone feature of the neglect syndrome, they,
alone, fail to compose a complete picture of the disorder.

Furthermore, recent attempts at rehabilitating neglect have shown
that while spatial attention can be improved, a range of
perceptual biases remain unaltered. As noted earlier, several
aversive and invasive treatments intended to trigger attentional
re-orienting to left space have been tried, with little clinical
effectiveness.  The most promising treatment has been prism
adaptation, because it is non-aversive, and because it has been
shown to produce effects lasting much longer than the treatment
duration [@Rossetti1998; @Farne2002; @Frassinetti2002].
Unfortunately, while prism adaptation produces striking changes in
spatial attention [@Striemer2007; @Nijboer2008], researchers have
begun to recognize an increasing number of neglect deficits that
are not improved by prism adaptation [@Rousseaux2006;
@Striemer2010tpd].  Many of these findings make use of perceptual
tasks, such the perceptual judgment of spatial extent
[@Dijkerman2003; @Striemer2010dpm], and chimeric faces
tasks[@Ferber2003; @Sarri2006].  It may be the case then that
prisms operate on neural systems important for the deployment of
attention, but have little to no effect on those mechanisms needed
to form accurate perceptual representations.

Part of the deficit involved in maintaining accurate perceptual
representations may be driven by working memory impairments. As
mentioned earlier, neglect patients have deficits of spatial
working memory generally, even in "non-neglected," right or
central space [@Husain2001; @Danckert2006].  In this context, it
is important to clarify the relationship between spatial working
memory and spatial attention.  The two systems appear to be
independent and functionally unique, generally residing in ventral
and dorsal visual systems, respectively, although there is some
functional overlap and mutual interaction [@Awh2001].
Specifically, in healthy people, mechanisms of spatial attention
provide a rehearsal-like function to maintain information held in
working memory [@Awh2001]. 

This arguably creates three possible causes of the apparent
spatial working memory problems in neglect; namely, that they may
actually be directly caused by attention deficits, they may be
caused by the disruption of access to attentional resources by
working memory systems, or, finally, they may arise independently,
from damage to regions specifically necessary for working memory
function. In the first case, it is possible that the neurological
architecture of working memory is healthy, but spatial attention
deficits prevent patients from performing adequately on the tasks,
producing the appearance of spatial working memory deficits.  This
seems less-likely, as patients maintain the ability to orient to
rightward and central targets effectively. However, we can not
rule out the possibility that subtle pathological orienting
deficits exist for central and right space that, in turn, impact
upon spatial working memory. If this was the case, though, we
might expect these deficits to improve as a result of improvement
in attention deficits, and this does not appear to be the case
[@Striemer2010tpd; @Striemer2010dpm; @Ferber2003; @Sarri2006]. In
the second case, of a disruption of access to attention by working
memory networks --- the ability, for example, of working memory to
utilize spatial attention for rehearsal --- may be disrupted in
neglect. This could be due to a compromise of the dorsal and
ventral stream connectivity, arising from the neglect-inducing
lesion.  Unlike the case of direct causation described above, if
disrupted communication between the two systems is the problem,
improvement in spatial attention may not have an impact on the
spatial working memory deficits.  The third possibility, where
working memory deficits are fully independent of spatial attention
deficits, would have this same property, and therefore, cannot be
clearly differentiated from a problem of disconnection in the
existing research. 

To overcome this problem, a new version of the working memory
task was created to minimize the possible reliance on spatial
attention rehearsal mechanisms. Rather than asking participants to
remember and recall strictly spatial information, memory for
target colour (or a combination of colour *and* spatial organization in a second
condition), was tested.  Placing the primary requirement of the
task on colour processing reduces reliance on spatial attention
and places any possible rehearsal mechanism requirements within
the ventral stream, eliminating the likelihood that measured
deficits would be the result of the hypothesized disrupted
communication
between the dorsal and ventral streams. If attention and working
memory deficits are indeed independent in neglect, then deficits
of a similar degree of severity would be expected on this task as
have been seen in past research employing a purely spatial WM
task.  That is, WM deficits will be evident even when the
involvement of spatial attention is low.
