\caption{Table presents demographic data, measures of attention (CES)
	and visual working memory, as well as performance on the three clinical
	measures of neglect by the patient group (described in Results). ``CES''
	indicates the leftward cue-effect-size on the COVAT test (RT difference 
	between valid and invalidly cued leftward targets). ``VWM(1)'' is the
	average probability a patient guesses the target colour in the single
	target condition (increased values indicate more guessing).
	``VWM(2/3)'' is the average probability a patient selects one of the
	distractor colours (high values indicate a colour-location
	binding deficit). Values for ``Stars'' are coded as the percentage of
	leftward stimuli missed on the Star Cancellation task. Neglect observed
	in figure copying is coded as a ``+'' under ``Copying.'' Line bisection
	performance is recorded as the bias, in terms of percentage of line
	length, with positive values indicating rightward bias, under
``Bisection.''}
