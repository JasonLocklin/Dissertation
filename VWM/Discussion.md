### Visual Working Memory Task 

[VWM single] The response precision data indicates that the
patients were able to perform the basic task of indicating a
colour to a similar degree of proficiency as the healthy 
groups, demonstrating that basic perceptual representations were
intact, and that they are able to perform the perceptual-motor response as
effectively as controls when they are able to recall the correct
visual information (Figure \ref{fig_VWM_Precision}). 

#### Guessing

When examining the apparent reliability of patient responses, the
data appears to indicate that neglect patients fail to recall the
colour of the stimuli and respond in a way that indicates
more prevalent guessing, in the single square condition (i.e.,
$P_G$, Figure \ref{fig_VWM_1Target}).  Interestingly,  this effect
was not significant in the multi-square condition (Figure
\ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}). In the single square condition, both
healthy groups performed near ceiling. When non-targets are
introduced in the multi-square conditions, all groups appear to
fail more often, but for the healthy groups the bulk of the new errors
appear to come from guessing (Figure \ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}). 
Deficits in the patients were not as clear cut.
This may represent a
different underlying failure, as guessing likely represents a
failure of memory for target colour, while non-target
selection represents a more complicated interaction, as discussed
below.

The lack of a significant group difference in guessing for the
multi-target condition may,
nevertheless, reflect limited sensitivity of the task variant. The
single square condition may be more effectively tuned to measure
simple visual working memory failures (i.e., guessing), as that is
the only type of failure in the condition. The parameters of the
task meant that the healthy groups performed near ceiling, and so
demonstrated less variability, perhaps allowing for more
sensitive statistical contrast with the patient group. 

#### Binding Errors

[VWM multi-target intro] When participants were asked to perform the
same VWM task in the presence of distractor "non-targets", two things change:
there is an increase in memory load, as patients are asked to
remember more items over the delay, and some of that information must be
associated, as patients must now bind colours and locations in 
working memory across the delay interval
[@Wheeler2002].  That is, in addition to remembering more than a
single colour, patients needed to remember the relative spatial
arrangement of those colours in order to answer correctly.  As a
result, two types of errors can be committed. A failure to recall
a colour (a guess), or a mis-identification of one of the
non-target distractors as belonging to the indicated spatial position
(non-target response). 


[VWM Multiple -mis-binding] Patients were more likely to
demonstrate colour-location binding errors than controls (Figure
\ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}).  There are many potential explanations for
this, the most obvious being failures of binding
information from the two domains in working memory. This type of 
cross-domain cognitive
process has previously been shown to be degraded in parietal and neglect
patients (@Humphreys2009; @Pisella2004).  When more than one
square is presented in the memory sample, colour information 
must be explicitly
associated with spatial location in memory and stored over the
delay.  If all of the colours
are effectively encoded and recalled, but a failure to bind the
colours to spatial location occurs, participants will select a
distractor colour about half of the time in the two-target condition,
and two thirds of the time in the three-target condition. 

The other event that can lead to this type of error is a simple
failure to recall the complete set of presented colours. If the
target colour cannot be recalled, but others can, it is possible
the participant may be inclined to select one of the distractor
colours, or something close to it, simply due to cognitive
anchoring. This experiment is not able to clearly disambiguate the
two causes.  However, if the large impairments observed here were 
caused by patients forgetting target colours, then it seems likely
that such frequent recall failures would have also lead to a
similarly large increase in the amount of guessing. As guessing
did not appear to stand out in this condition, binding errors are
the more likely culprit.

### Covert Orienting
[COVAT] Conclusions about the covert orienting data is more
limited, as only five of the eight patients were able to perform the task, and
only two of them performed well outside the healthy range ---
although it is reasonable to suggest that the three patients who
failed to detect any left sided targets also performed well outside
the normal range.
The three patients unable to complete the covert orienting 
task also exhibited the strongest
symptoms of neglect on the clinical measures. As a result, the
analysis is based on only the subset of moderately neglecting patients.
Nevertheless, as a group, those patients able to complete the task
did perform more poorly than the healthy controls, so it is unlikely that those
two extreme cases are artifacts of chance. Moreover, the non-parametric
comparison is un-affected by the large magnitude of deficit in
those two cases, as it is based on rank-order, lending more support
to the notion that the groups as a whole are, in fact, different. 

Nevertheless, others have typically found clearer alignment
between clinical results and orienting performance [@Posner1984;
@Morrow1988; @Losier2001], so it is likely that experimental
constraints limited sensitivity.  For example, the two short
stimulus onset timings were chosen to prevent the need for eye
movement monitoring (i.e., at 150ms SOA, targets appear before eye
movements can be initiated), but this may have limited cue effect
size sensitivity by reducing the opportunity for complete
attentional orienting.  Also, patients were asked to perform only
100 trials to avoid undue fatigue, but this may have limited the
power of the experiment, as other research has utilized
considerably more trials [e.g., @Posner1984; @Morrow1988; @Danckert1997].

In contrast, it is also well established that the paper and pencil
clinical tests of neglect have limited sensitivity and, by their nature, are
not capable of capturing the complete spectrum and
heterogeneity of deficits across patients [@Danckert2006].
Participant 171, for example, had demonstrated neglect in a
clinical setting previously, but at the time of testing, no longer
showed symptoms on the clinical tests.  Despite this, considering
the large leftward re-orienting deficit demonstrated on the 
covert orienting task, it would be
premature to claim complete recovery. It is more likely that this
is a case where the three clinical tests used here are poorly
matched with remaining deficits; an extreme example of a general
reality that paper and pencil tasks alone will present
an incomplete picture, and as a result, will not always agree
with measures of other components of the disorder. 

[3 non-responders]  The three patients who were unable to complete the
covert orienting task *did* effectively show striking deficits of
leftward orienting, but the task was not able to quantify
their performance, reducing the power of the above analysis.
Nevertheless, these strongly biased patients also demonstrated the
most severe deficits on the clinical tests of neglect, further supporting
the connection between leftward re-orienting on the covert
orienting task, and the clinical measures. 

### Comparison of the Tasks

The logistic regression indicated that one of the two deficits of
visual working memory ---
guessing in the single target condition --- significantly described
group affiliation, even when partialled on covert orienting
performance. If visual working memory deficits were merely
consequences of a deficit of spatial attention, then one would not
expect a measure of visual working memory to uniquely describe the
patient group above and beyond an established measure of the
attentional deficit (i.e., leftward covert re-orienting).
It is possible, but unlikely, that the visual working memory test used here
is a more sensitive, if indirect, measure of attention deficits
than the covert orienting task --- a well tested and direct
measure of attention. 
Fortunately, the relationship can also be
examined by considering the patients on a case-by-case basis.

The three most severely neglecting patients demonstrated
consistently degraded performance on all tasks, lending support to
the claim that the clinical, visual working memory, and covert
orienting tasks are all affected by a common underlying deficit.
However, the remaining five patients presenting with
moderate-to-weak neglect symptoms present a much
less consistent relationship (Table \ref{tbl_VWM}). One patient
presents with a very large leftward CES, along with degraded
performance, relative to peers on most of the remaining tasks;
while another presents the opposite picture, doing exceedingly
well on the non-covert orienting tasks.  Generally, CES rank
matches line bisection performance, though, this is not without
exception. However, in only the one case, mentioned above, does
covert orienting and visual working memory performance appear to
be consistent. This lack of a reliably similar performance across
the range of the two tasks hints at the decoupled nature of the
two domains in neglect. 

Most rehabilitation techniques implemented in neglect focus on
remediating impairments of attention. If attention deficits
are indeed distinct from working memory impairments as suggested 
here and elsewhere [e.g.; @Husain2001; @Danckert2006;
@Striemer2013], then this rehabilitation strategy will fail to
address this domain, and may leave patients with untreated
symptoms.  The next chapter addresses this question by examining
the effects of a prominent rehabilitation technique on
non-attentional biases.
