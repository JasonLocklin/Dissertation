### Visual Working Memory Task 

[VWM single] The response precision data indicates that the
patients were able to perform the basic task of indicating a
colour to a similar degree of proficiency as the healthy 
groups, demonstrating that basic perceptual representations were
intact, and that they are able to perform the perceptual-motor response as
effectively as controls when they are able to recall the correct
visual information (figure \ref{fig_VWM_Precision}). 

#### Guessing

When examining the apparent reliability of patient responses, the
data appears to indicate that neglect patients fail to recall the
colour of the square stimuli and respond in a way that indicates
more prevalent guessing in the single square condition (i.e.,
$P_G$, figure \ref{fig_VWM_1Target}).  Interestingly,  this effect
was not significant in the multi-square condition (figure
\ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}). In the single square condition, both
healthy groups perform near ceiling. When non-targets are
introduced in the multi-square conditions, all groups appear to
fail more often, but for the healthy groups the bulk of the errors
appear to be guessing (figure \ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}). The patient
group, in contrast, exhibits broadly similar guessing
probabilities as in the single square condition, but significantly
inflated binding errors, relative to the healthy groups (discussed
below).

The lack of a significant group guessing difference may,
nevertheless, reflect limited sensitivity of the task variant. The
single square condition may be more effectively tuned to measure
simple visual working memory failures (i.e., guessing), as that is
the only type of failure in the condition. The parameters of the
task meant that the healthy groups performed near ceiling, and so
demonstrated less variability, perhaps allowing for more
sensitive statistical contrast with the patient group. 

#### Binding Errors

[VWM multi-target intro] When participants were asked to perform the
same VWM task in the presence of distractor "non-targets", two things change:
there is an increase in memory load, as patients are asked to
remember more items over the delay, and some of that information must be
associated, as patients must now bind colours and locations
[@Wheeler2002].  That is, in addition to remembering more than a
single colour, patients needed to remember the relative spatial
arrangement of those colours in order to answer correctly.  As a
result, two types of errors can be committed. A failure to recall
a colour (a guess), or a mis-identification of one of the
non-target distractors as belonging to the indicated spatial position
(non-target response). 


[VWM Multiple -mis-binding] Patients appeared to be more likely to
demonstrate colour-location binding errors than controls (Figure
\ref{fig_VWM_MTarget}).  There are many potential explanations for
this, the most obvious being an increase in failures of binding
information from the two domains in working memory. This type of 
cross-domain cognitive
process has previously been shown degraded in parietal and neglect
patients (@Humphreys2009; @Pisella2004).  When more than one
square is presented in the memory sample, colour information 
must be explicitly
associated with spatial location in memory and stored over the
delay.  If all of the colours
are effectively encoded and recalled, but a failure to bind the
colours to spatial location occurs, participants will select a
distractor colour about half of the time in the two-target condition,
and two thirds of the time in the three-target condition. 

The other event that can lead to this type of error is a simple
failure to recall the complete set of stimuli colours. If the
target colour cannot be recalled, but others can, it is possible
the participant may be inclined to select one of the distractor
colours, or something close to it, by strategy or cognitive
anchoring. This experiment is not able to clearly disambiguate the
two causes.  However, if the large deficit observed here was
caused by patients forgetting target colours, then it seems likely
that such frequent recall failures would have also lead to a
similarly large increase in the amount of guessing. As guessing
did not appear to increase in this condition, binding errors are
the more likely culprit.

### Covert Orienting
[COVAT] Conclusions about the covert orienting data is more
limited, as only 5 of the 8 patients were able to perform the task, and
only 2 of them performed well outside the healthy range.
Nevertheless, as a group, those patients able to complete the task
did poorer than the healthy controls, so it's unlikely that those
two extreme cases are artifacts of chance. Moreover, the non-parametric
comparison is un-affected by the large magnitude of deficit in
those two cases, as it's based on rank-order, lending more support
to the notion that the groups as a whole are, in fact, different. 

Nevertheless, Others have typically found clearer alignment
between clinical results and orienting performance [@Posner1984;
@Morrow1988; @Losier2001], so it's likely that experimental
constraints limited sensitivity.  For example, the two short
stimulus onset timings were chosen prevent the need for eye
movement monitoring (i.e., at 150ms SOA, targets appear before eye
movement could be initiated), but this may have limited cue effect
size sensitivity by reducing the opportunity for complete
attentional orienting.  Also, patients were asked to perform only
100 trials to avoid undue fatigue, but this may have limited the
power of the experiment, as other research has utilized
considerably more [e.g., @Posner1984; @Morrow1988; @Danckert1997].

In contrast, it's also well established that the paper and pencil
clinical tests have limited sensitivity and, by their nature, are
not likely capable of capturing the complete spectrum and
heterogeneity of deficits across patients [@Danckert2006].
Participant 171, for example, had demonstrated neglect in a
clinical setting previously, but at time of testing, no longer
showed symptoms on the clinical tests.  Despite this, considering
the large leftward re-orienting deficit demonstrated on the 
covert orienting task, it would be
premature to claim complete recovery. It's more likely that this
is case where the three clinical tests used here are poorly
matched with remaining deficits; an extreme example of a general
reality that paper and pencil tasks alone will present
an incomplete picture, and as a result, will not always match well
with measures of other components of the disorder. 

[3 non-responders]  The three patients who were unable to complete the
covert orienting task did effectively show striking deficits of
leftward orienting, but the task was not able to quantify
their performance, reducing the power of the above analysis.
Nevertheless, these strongly biased patients were also the
three most neglecting on the clinical tests, further supporting
the connection between leftward re-orienting on the covert
orienting task, and the clinical measures. Future research should consider
calibrating experimental parameters to suit the strongest
neglecting patients if possible. Parameters such as the size, brightness, and
eccentricity of stimuli, as well as other techniques like
flashing stimuli, can be used to increase the saliency enough that
more severely neglecting patients are able to respond.

### Comparison of the Tasks

The logistic regression indicated that one of the two measures of
visual working memory found to be degraded in the patient group,
guessing in the single target condition, significantly described
group affiliation, even when partialled on covert orienting
performance. If visual working memory deficits were merely
consequences of a deficit of spatial attention, then one would not
expect a measure of visual working memory to uniquely describe the
patient group above and beyond an established measure of the
attentional neglect deficit (i.e., leftward covert re-orienting).
While it is possible that the visual working memory test used here
is a more sensitive, if indirect, measure of attention deficits
than the well tested, and direct, measure of the covert orienting
task, but unlikely. Fortunately, the relationship can also be
examined by considering the patients on a case-by-case basis.

The three most severely neglecting patients demonstrated
consistently degraded performance on all tasks, lending support to
the claim that the clinical, visual working memory, and covert
orienting are testing factors related to neglect in some way.
However, the remaining 5 weaker neglecting patients present a much
less consistent relationship (table \ref{tbl_VWM}). One patient
presents a very large leftward CES, along with degraded
performance, relative to peers on most of the remaining tasks;
while another presents the opposite picture, doing exceedingly
well on the non-covert orienting tasks.  Generally, CES rank
matches line bisection performance, though, this is not without
exception. However, in only the one case, mentioned above, does
covert orienting and visual working memory performance appear to
be consistent. This lack of reliably similar performance across
the range of the two tasks hints at the decoupled nature of the
two domains in neglect. 

### Moving Foreword

[Heterogeneity of neglect means within-subject is better] Despite
the fact that 8 patients with neglect were recruited for this
study, as can be seen from the results, there are several issues
with making strong claims about group differences. Most notably,
neglect patients are a highly heterogeneous group, with widely
varying degrees of deficits, and different relationships between
the deficits. Clinical measures such as those used here may not be
sensitive enough, or cover enough domains of performance, to
detect deficits still present in the individual.  Further
research, would benefit from within-subject designs, such as
before-and-after certain treatments, or longitudinally, as
patients recover. Such designs would avoid some of the problems
inherent in group-wise comparisons hamstrung by the heterogeneity
of the disorder.  The clinical symptoms, covert orienting
deficits, and visual working memory deficits examined here may
emerge from damage to un-related or weakly-linked domains of the
neglect disorder, but further research with larger sample sizes,
preferably making use of repeated measures designs, are needed to
explore this further.

Most rehabilitation techniques implemented in neglect focus on
remediating the attention deficits. If these attention deficits
are indeed distinct from the working memory impairments discussed
here and elsewhere (e.g.; @Husain2001; @Danckert2006;
@Striemer2013), then this rehabilitation strategy will fail to
address this domain, and may leave patients with untreated
symptoms.  The next chapter addresses this question by examining
the effects of a prominent rehabilitation technique on
non-attentional biases.
