Discussion
==========

[VWM single] The response precision data indicates that the
patients were able to perform the basic task of indicating a
colour to a similar degree of proficiency as the two control
groups, demonstrating that basic perceptual representations are
in-tact, and that they are able to perform the motor response as
effectively as controls when they are able to recall the correct
visual information. In contrast, when examining the apparent
reliability of patient's recollections, the data appears to
indicate that neglect patients fail to recall the colour of
targets and respond in a way that indicates more prevalent
guessing.

[VWM Multiple -guessing] When participants were asked to perform the
same VWM task in the presence of distractors, two things change:
there is an increase in memory load, as patients are asked to
remember more items, and some of that information must be
associated, as patients must now bind colours and locations.  That
is, in addition to remembering more than a single colour, patients
needed to remember the relative spatial arrangement of those
colours in order to answer correctly.  As a result, two types of
errors can be committed. A failure to recall a colour (a guess),
or a mis-identification of one of the distractors as belonging to
the indicated spatial position (non-target selection). This latter
error represents a binding error by associating a distractor
colour with the target location (tk Binding errors citation:
Treisman, Behrmann or Humphreys and Riddoch).



Interestingly, in contrast to the single target condition, the
patient group does not appear to guess more frequently than the
other groups. This may reflect a limited sensitivity, as in the
multi-target condition, binding errors appear to be the
overwhelming source of failures. While the single-target condition
is effectively tuned to detect guessing (as that's the only type
of error), the multi-target conditions simply provides less
oportunity to detect guessing, both in terms of space on the
colour bar and in terms of response frequency, given the three
possible outcome probabilitites.


[VWM Multiple -mis-binding] Unlike guessing, patients were more
likely to select non-targets in multi-target conditions.  There
are many potential explanations for this, the most obvious being a
failure of binding. An error in the recollection of the spatial
arrangement of targets and distractors would lead a participant to
inaccurately associate colours and locations. If the colours were
remembered perfectly, but their individual spatial locations lost,
this would lead to this type of error half, and two-thirds of the
time by chance, for the two and three target conditions
respectively. The other event that can lead to this type of error
is a simple failure to recall all of the target colours. If the
target colour cannot be recalled, it is possible the participant
may be inclined to select one of the other colours, or something
close to it, by strategy or cognitive anchoring. While this
experiment is not able to clearly disambiguate the two causes, if
the large deficit observed here was caused by patients forgetting
target colours, than it seems likely that such frequent recal
failures would have also lead to a similar increase in the amount
of guessing. As guessing didn't appear to increase, binding errors
are the more likely culprit.

[Possible explanations] Without further research, it is unclear why
neglect may induce visual recollection failures in the single target
condition, and mis-recollection in the multi-target condition, but there
are several possibilities. First, it is important to note that there are
two changes from single to multiple target conditions. Besides the
addition of the spatial task, there is the requirement to remember more
visual information. If patients struggled to recall a single colour in
the first condition, it is possible that, at least some of the time,
they only remembered a single colour in the multi-target condition,
either by strategy or necessity. This would appear to be a
colour-location binding error, but would, in fact, be a simple visual
working memory failure. A second possibility is that spatial binding
errors in the multiple-target condition simply overwhelm simple
colour-recollection errors, and produce an experiment that is
insufficiently sensitive to the latter in order to be able to measure
the deficit successfully. The two conditions may always be required to
measure the two types of memory failures. Third, it should not be
automatically discounted that a difference in the healthy control groups
might account for the failure to identify group differences in guessing
in the multi-target condition. The control groups perform almost
perfectly on the single target condition, but fell away from this
"ceiling" somewhat on the multi-target condition. The difference between
neglect and healthy performance may simply be more accentuated when the
task is calibrated such that healthy performance is near perfect and not
highly variable.

[COVAT] The data also brings to light some difficulties with the covert
orienting task in the study of neglect. Neglect is often defined in
terms of attention, but in this case, for three patients, leftward
re-orienting of attention appeared to be less sensitive a measure of
neglect than the paper and pencil standard clinical measures. As used
here, it appears to suffer from a restriction of range problem. While
several of the most severely neglecting participants could not complete
the task at all, several others, whom still exhibited signs of neglect
on at least one clinical measure, performed well inside normal
parameters. The apparent failure of the task to capture either subtle or
strong deficits indicates that the task, as it was used here, may not be
very effective for capturing the range of attention deficits in neglect,
or useful for the comparison of attention and other deficits in neglect.

FIXME: 3 non left-orientors were worst performing VWM
participants.

[Comparison of tasks] While a reliable statistical comparison of the two
tasks was made impossible by the inability of several participants to
complete the task, there is some information that may be gleaned from
what remains, and provide hints toward further research. The two
patients with strikingly poor ability to re-orient leftward did not
stand out as being particularly degraded on either visual working memory
or clinical measures of neglect. In fact, one of them didn't show
clinical neglect at all. This should serve as a cautionary note, hinting
that it's may be possible for some individuals to exhibit strong
leftward covert orienting deficits in the absence of symptoms on
clinical measures, (or visual working memory deficits?).

[Heterogeneity of neglect means within-subject is better] Despite the
fact that 8 patients with neglect were recruited for this study, as can
be seen from the results, there are several issues with making strong
claims about group differences. Most notably, neglect patients are a
highly heterogeneous group, with widely varying degrees of deficits, and
different relationships between the deficits. Clinical measures such as
those used here may not be sensitive enough, or cover enough domains of
performance, to detect deficits still present in the individual. Further
research, besides avoiding the covert orienting task as a measure of
spatial deficits, would benefit from within-subject designs, such as
before-and-after certain treatments, or longitudinally, as patients
recover. Such designs would avoid some of the problems inherent in
group-wise comparisons hamstrung by the heterogeneity of the disorder.
The clinical symptoms, covert orienting deficits, and visual working
memory deficits examined here may emerge from damage to un-related or
weakly-linked domains of the neglect disorder, but further research with
larger sample sizes, preferably making use of repeated measures designs,
will be required.

Most rehabilitation techniques implemented in neglect focus on
remediating the attention deficits. If these attention deficits are
distinct from the working memory impairments discussed here and
elsewhere (tk), than this rehabilitation strategy will fail to address
this domain, and leave patients with untreated disorder. The next
chapter addresses this question by examining the effects of a prominent
rehabilitation technique on non-attentional biases.
