Unilateral neglect is a disorder in which patients behave as if
the left half of space has ceased to exist. The disorder typically
arises from right hemisphere brain damage involving the inferior
parietal and superior temporal cortices. Classic models of neglect
have suggested that the disorder represents impaired attentional
functioning. More recently, research has suggested that the
heterogeneous symptoms of neglect can not be fully explained by
recourse to attentional deficits alone. This thesis first examined
performance on both visual working memory and attention tasks in
patients with right brain damage, some of whom presented with
neglect. Results showed severe deficits in both domains. Next,
prism adaptation, a treatment long understood to improve attention
in neglect, was used to examine whether the technique could
improve performance in domains not specifically related to
attention. Results showed that prisms failed to meaningfully
improve severe deficits in time perception and spatial working
memory in non-neglected space. Such deficits in non-spatial
attention domains may be the result of damage to perceptual
systems. The final experimental chapter examined the potential for
saccadic adaptation, an analogue of prism adaptation previously
shown to induce some perceptual change, to ameliorate both
perception and action deficits in neglect.  Here, healthy
individuals performed the classic saccadic adaptation paradigm,
with performance on a line bisection and landmark task used as
indices of action and perception respectively. The task was not found
to measurably influence either domain. Overall, the thesis
supports recent research that claims that neglect involves 
independant deficits, involving more than just attention.
Specifically, it provides evidence that working memory and
perceptual deficits are not strongly coupled to spatial
attention.
