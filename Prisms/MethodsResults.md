### Participants
Nine patients with right parietal damage who had shown clinical symptoms of neglect
in previous testing were recruited from the Neurological
patient database (tk). Two patients were unable to return for the second phase of
the experiment because of extenuating circumstances, and a third participant was
removed from the study because of extensive cerebellar damage. The remaining six,
(tk male, tk female)
patients completed the task. The group had a mean age of tk ($SD=tk$), and tk were
right handed. The study was
approved by the relevant hospital and institutional ethics
review boards. All patients were tested
at least tk months post-stroke. One participant was not able to perform the 
spatial working memory task (giving a single response to all trials), and was 
therefore removed from that component of the analysis.

TODO: Dig up age, handedness and gender and time-post-stroke on the patients.

### Apparatus and Procedure

Patients participated in at least two sessions. The two sessions were intended 
to differ only in the presence or absence of prism adaptation. In one case, a 
patient would be too tired to complete the testing during the session, but 
succeeded in a further session. 

Like in the previous chapter, patients were tested for symptoms of neglect using
four standard clinical measures. These were line bisection, figure copying, 
and two cancellation tasks: "stars" and "bells". The four tasks were completed
during every session. Line bisection was also performed twice during sessions 
involving prisms, before and after adaptation. Coding and analysis of the tasks
were performed in the same way as in Chapter 1. The results of the clinical 
measures are depicted in figure tk.

#### Spatial Working Memory Task

The spatial working memory (SWM) task is a similar, simpler relative of the 
visual working memory task used in the last chapter. Patients were seated at a 
viewing distance of approximately 60 cm, with the head and body axes were aligned
(no chin-rest was used, optical angles presented below are therefore approximate). 
The task was programmed in tk (by tk), and displayed on a tk computer with a 
tk inch display. The task was the same as described in @Ferber2006 and @Striemer2013.
At the beginning of each trial, patients fixated a 
red central cross. Once fixated, the experimenter began the trial by depressing
a key and the cross turned green. After 1 second, three targets were 
presented 2º to the right of fixation, vertically aligned. The targets were 
squares subtending 1.5º, and could appear in any of six positions, however, they 
were always separated from one-another by at least 2º. 

The targets remained on-screen for 2 seconds, disappeared for 3 seconds, and then
a target circle of the same size appeared at one of the possible 6 positions. This
target remained on the screen until a response was entered via the keyboard 
(See figure tk for a visual depiction of the task). The patients were asked to 
remember the locations of the squares across the 3 second interval and then 
verbally report to the experimenter whether or not the circle appeared in the 
same location as one of the preceding squares.  A total of 120 trials constituted
a single session. In 50/% of trials, the circle appeared in the same position
as one of the preceding squares. 

#### Temporal Estimation Task

The Temporal Estimation (TE) task was displayed on the same computer as the 
SWM task, but was programmed in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools). As with 
the SWM task, patients gave verbal responses, and the experimenter entered 
those responses and controlled the task via the keyboard. The task was the 
same as @Danckert2007. When a trial was initiated by the experimenter, an
illusory motion stimulus consisting of eight open circles (each subtending
3.5º), arranged in a larger circle around the centre of the screen (radius of
8º), with each circle becoming filled, one at a time, in a clockwise direction
(see figure tk).

The successive filling of circles produced the illusion of a
filled-circle moving around the outer circle. Rather than a fixation, the
centre of the screen periodically displayed a number (numbers 1-9, presented
for 300ms, 1.5º in size), which the participant was asked to verbally report
as they appeared. This effectively maintained central fixation for the
patients and provided a check that participants were attending to the task,
and attempted to prevent participants from sub-audibly counting out the
interval duration. To avoid problems with responses, certain constraints were
placed on the appearance of the numbers. They would not appear less than 500ms
from the beginning or end of the trial, or another number. The interval
between numbers was also never more than 1500ms. At the conclusion of the
trial, the circles disappear and the participant was asked to indicate,
verbally, the duration of the interval. The intervals were randomly chosen
from 5, 15, 30, and 60 seconds.

### Data Analysis

As in chapter one, line bisection bias was coded as a percentage of line-length,
and star- and bell-cancellation tasks, based on the percentage of left-side targets
that were missed. All measures were computed pre- and post-prisms, and where 
multiple sessions were performed, values were averaged. Summary means were 
included in table tk.

In the spatial working memory task, there are two types of trials, those where 
the final, circle, is in the same 
location as one of the initial squares, and those where that is not the case.
Based on the two responses, the trial responses was categorized as true- and 
false-positives, and true- and false-negatives (positive and negative indicating
the responses, and true and false indicating whether the response was 
correct).  A single sensitivity metric was calculated for each patient, pre- and
post-prisms, was
calculated by subtracting false-positives
from true-positives (i.e., "hits" - "false alarms"). Normative performance in
healthy individuals from
pre-existing research with this task was used to provide context to these 
values.

The temporal estimation task analyzed the time interval estimates the patients
reported.
For each patient, a mean of reported times was calculated for each time interval,
both for pre and post prisms data. An ANOVA, and direct comparisons of the 
means for each time interval were performed to examine the effect of prisms.
In addition, linear models were computed for each individual across the time 
intervals, and the group mean slopes for pre and post prisms were compared.


Results
=======

### Spatial Working Memory Task
As a group, SWM performance does statistically improve when a one-sided test is used
(presuming prisms would not decrease performance, $t(4)=2.67$, $\text{p} < 0.05$).
When consulting figure tk, it becomes obvious, however, that while improvement
may be relatively reliable, it usually does not bring patients' performance into the range
observed in healthy individuals. Patient 27, who did not show evidence of neglect 
on any of the clinical measures, performed well within the range observed in healthy,
and non-neglecting right brain damaged patients in the past. All four patients 
showing clinical signs of neglect still showed large deficits post-prisms, compared 
with the performance of non-neglecting right brain damaged patients previously 
examined on this test (z-scores between 3.4 and 7.2). When compared with
performance of neurologically intact controls (the lighter region in figure tk), 
patient 171 does cross
into a region statistically indistinguishable from normative performance ($z=1.2$),
but the others remain well outside ($3.1 < z < 5.0$).

FIXME: In the figure, I use bands of 2 SD, rather than the 95% CI used the previous studies. It looks less impressive, but I think it's more appropriate. 

FIXME: Above should probably have Crawford results in addition to z-scores, but I'll leave it for now.

### Temporal Estimation Task

As can be observed in figure tk, the five patients who showed clinical signs of 
neglect massively underestimated the time intervals (Patient 27 underestimated 
to some degree pre-prisms, and responded very accurately post-prisms. tk). 
As a result, analysis was done both with and without including Patient 27, and
results did not differ. What is presented here is the data discluding patient 27.
An analysis of variance performed, with both prisms and trial duration included
as fixed factors, did not identify a significant effect of prisms, or an interaction
involving prisms (see table tk). While trial duration produced a significant effect
on response magnitudes, the theoretical importance is negligible. Because of 
this, an alternative analysis using ANCOVA, with trial duration as a covariate,
and, even here, there was no indication of an effect of prisms 
($F(1,4)= 0.79$, $\text{p}=0.4).

FIXME: Individual t tests at each interval also fails to show prisms effect.

FIXME: I could also include something that demonstrates the severity of the deficit, but it's pretty obvious from the figure.


### Line bisection

As a group, the neglecting patients showed a significant change in line bisection
bias after prism adaptation in the direction traditionally seen in the research,
provided a one-sided test is used 
(patient 27 removed, $t(4)=2.6$, $\text{p} = 0.03$). 

Individual t tests on the sets of line bisections for each patient (see table tk? or 
inline in next sentences).
All patients showed significant change post prisms except 163 and 408 (with the 
latter not quite reaching significance due to extreme trial-to-trial variability).
As can be seen in figure tk, the changes were universally leftward except for 
patient 27, the non-neglecting patient.

TODO: Add error bars to figure.

As a group, the neglecting patients did not improve on either bell 
($t(4)=0.6$, $\text{p}=0.5$), or star cancellation ($t(4)=1.7$, $\text{p}=0.2$),
and, as can be seen in table (tk clinical results table), only one patient 
showed improvement on figure copying (Patient 171).

FIXME: We should discuss if a figure should be made for cancellation tasks, and 
how the table of clinical results, if at all, should look. 

FIXME: Not sure if there are any direct comparisons between tasks that should be done. If so, they will go here.
