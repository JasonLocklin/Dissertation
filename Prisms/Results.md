### Spatial Working Memory Task

Replicating previous research using this spatial working memory
task [@Ferber2006; @Striemer2013], all of the patients who were
showing clinical signs of neglect performed very poorly.  Figure
[fig:SWM] plots the patient mean accuracy along with expected
range (2 standard deviations from the means) of the neurologically
intact, and non-neglecting right brain damaged participants from
@Ferber2006. While the patient who did not demonstrate neglect on
the clinical tasks at time of testing (27) performed similarly to
the non-neglecting group, the remaining patients baseline
performance was at least 3 standard deviations outside what was
observed in either group.

damaged (dark band) controls from @Ferber2006.}
\end{figure}



As a group, SWM performance does statistically improve when a
one-sided test is used (presuming prisms would not decrease
performance, $t(4)=2.67$, $\text{p} < 0.05$). When consulting
figure [fig:SWM], it becomes obvious, however, that there is not a
consistently large improvement across all patients, and even those
who did improve did not demonstrate performance in the range
expected from healthy individuals (figure [fig:SWM]). All four
patients showing clinical signs of neglect still showed large
deficits post-prisms, compared with the performance of
non-neglecting right brain damaged patients previously examined on
this test (z-scores between 3.4 and 7.2). When compared with
performance of the more variable, neurologically intact
right-brain damaged individuals (the lighter region in figure
[fig:SWM]), Patient 171 does cross into a region statistically
indistinguishable from normative performance ($z=1.2$), but the
others remain well outside ($3.1 < z < 5.0$).

### Temporal Estimation Task 

As can be observed in figure [fig:TE], the five patients who
showed clinical signs of neglect massively underestimated the time
intervals. In contrast, Patient 27, the non-neglecting patient,
underestimated to some degree pre-prisms, and responded very
accurately post-prisms (Figure [fig:TE]). As a result, analysis
was done both with and without including Patient 27, and results
did not differ.  What is presented here is the data excluding
Patient 27.  An analysis of covariance was performed, with prism
condition as a fixed factor and trial duration as a random
covariate, and there was no indication of an influence of prisms
on time interval estimation ($F(1,4)= 0.79$, $\text{p}=0.4$). 

For each participant and condition, a linear model (least squares)
was computed in order to yield a measure of the relationship
(slope) between time intervals and estimations. As can be seen in
figure [fig:TE], the relationship was not recti-linear (first
order), so linear models were computed based on log-transformed
time. When this was done, linear models fit very well (13 models,
$r^2$: first quartile $=0.80$, median $=0.87$, third quartile $=0.92$).
The worst case model was, nevertheless, still significant
($F(1,14)=12.4$, $\text{p}< 0.01$, $r^2=0.47$), indicating that
despite their poor performance, patients' responses were, in fact,
reliably influenced by the true trial intervals.

### Line bisection

As a group, the neglecting patients showed a significant change in
line bisection bias after prism adaptation in the direction
traditionally seen in the research, when a one-sided test was used
(Patient 27 removed, $t(4)=2.6$, $\text{p} = 0.03$).  Individual t
tests on the sets of line bisections for each patient, with a bonferonni
adjusted criteria ($\alpha = 0.008$), demonstrated
a relatively consistent effect across individuals. As can be seen
in figure [fig:LB_Prisms], the changes were nearly-universally
leftward excepting Patient 27, the non-neglecting patient.
Patient's 95, 97, and 171 demonstrated significant leftward shifts
in bias post-prisms 
($t(16)=3.3$, $\text{p} < 0.008$, 
$t(17)=4.1$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, 
$t(18)=3.2$, $\text{p} < 0.008$, respectively).  Patient 27
demonstrates a direction of change opposite to what is expected,
and what the rest of the participants show, but this change is
non-significant with the bonferonni adjusted criteria ($\alpha =
0.008$, $t(18)=-2.70$, $\text{p} = 0.015$).  Patient 408 produced
the largest average difference in bias, but was also highly
variable, and as a result, did not demonstrate statistically
significant change ($t(12)=1.9$, $\text{p} = 0.08$).  Patient 163
clearly did not show measurable change post-prisms ($t(10)=1.2$,
$\text{p} = 0.3$).

As a group, the neglecting patients did not improve on either
bells ($t(4)=0.6$, $\text{p}=0.5$), or star cancellation
($t(4)=1.7$, $\text{p}=0.2$), and, as can be seen in table
\ref{tbl_Prisms}, only one patient showed improvement on figure
copying (Patient 171).
