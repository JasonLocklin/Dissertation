### Spatial Working Memory Task

FIXME: add paragraph describing deficited performance.

As a group, SWM performance does statistically improve when a one-sided
test is used (presuming prisms would not decrease performance,
$t(4)=2.67$, $\text{p} < 0.05$). When consulting figure tk, it becomes
obvious, however, that there is not a consistently large improvement
across all patients, and even those who did improve did not demonstrate
performance in the range observed in healthy individuals (figure tk).
Patient 27, who did not show evidence of neglect on any of the clinical
measures, performed well within the range observed in healthy, and
non-neglecting right brain damaged patients in the past. All four
patients showing clinical signs of neglect still showed large deficits
post-prisms, compared with the performance of non-neglecting right brain
damaged patients previously examined on this test (z-scores between 3.4
and 7.2). When compared with performance of neurologically intact
controls (the lighter region in figure tk), patient 171 does cross into
a region statistically indistinguishable from normative performance
($z=1.2$), but the others remain well outside ($3.1 < z < 5.0$).

### Temporal Estimation Task

As can be
observed in figure tk, the five patients who showed clinical signs of
neglect massively underestimated the time intervals (Patient 27
underestimated to some degree pre-prisms, and responded very accurately
post-prisms. tk). As a result, analysis was done both with and without
including Patient 27, and results did not differ. What is presented here
is the data excluding patient 27. An analysis of variance performed,
with both prisms and trial duration included as fixed factors, did not
identify a significant effect of prisms, or an interaction involving
prisms (table tk). While trial duration produced a significant effect on
response magnitudes, the theoretical importance is negligible. Because
of this, an alternative analysis using ANCOVA, with trial duration as a
covariate was employed, and, even here, there was no indication of an
effect of prisms ($F(1,4)= 0.79$, $\text{p}=0.4$).

### Line bisection

As a group, the
neglecting patients showed a significant change in line bisection bias
after prism adaptation in the direction traditionally seen in the
research, provided a one-sided test is used (patient 27 removed,
$t(4)=2.6$, $\text{p} = 0.03$). Individual t tests on the sets of line
bisections for each patient demonstrated a relatively consistent effect
across individuals (see table tk).  All patients showed significant
change post prisms except 163 and 408 (with the latter not quite
reaching significance due to extreme trial-to-trial variability).  As
can be seen in figure tk, the changes were universally leftward except
for patient 27, the non-neglecting patient.

TODO: Add error bars to figure.

TODO: Create table of individual t tests.

As a group, the neglecting patients did not improve on either bell ($t(4)=0.6$, $\text{p}=0.5$),
or star cancellation ($t(4)=1.7$, $\text{p}=0.2$), and, as can be seen in table (tk clinical
results table), only one patient showed improvement on figure copying
(Patient 171).
