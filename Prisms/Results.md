### Spatial Working Memory Task

Replicating previous research using this spatial working memory
task [@Ferber2006; @Striemer2013], most of the patients performed
very poorly.  Figure
\ref{fig_SWM} plots the patient mean accuracy along with expected
normal range, based on the performance of two non-neglecting
groups tested on the identical task by
@Ferber2006. While one patient performed similarly to
the non-neglecting group (Patient 27, one of the two patients no longer
demonstrating neglect on clinical tasks), the remaining patients baseline
performance was at least 3 standard deviations outside what was
observed in either group.

\caption{Figure depicts pre and post-prism SWM performance for all
participants. In order to depict performance expected from
non-neglecting individuals, means and bands of $\pm 2$ standard
deviations from non-neglecting right brain damaged (dark band,
$n=4$, one female, ages: 55, 55, 68, and 78. All $> 3$ months post
stroke) and neurologically intact controls (light band, $n=10$,
age matched) from @Ferber2006 are overlaid the participant data.}
\label{fig_SWM}
\end{figure}



As a group, SWM performance does statistically improve when a
one-sided test is used (presuming prisms would not decrease
performance, $t(4)=2.67$, $\text{p} < 0.05$). When consulting
Figure \ref{fig_SWM}, it becomes obvious, however, that the change
is small relative to the size of the deficit. All four patients
showing clinical signs of neglect at the time of testing still
demonstrated large deficits post-prisms, compared with the
performance of non-neglecting right brain damaged patients
previously examined on
this test (z-scores between 3.4 and 7.2). When compared with
performance of the more variable, right-brain damaged population
(the lighter region in Figure \ref{fig_SWM}), Patient 171 does
cross into a region statistically indistinguishable from normative
performance ($z=1.2$), but the others remain well outside this
range ($3.1 < z < 5.0$).

### Temporal Estimation Task

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig_TE}, the five patients who
showed clinical signs of neglect massively underestimated the time
intervals. Again, Patient 27, one of two patients no longer
demonstrating neglect on clinical tasks,
underestimated to only a minor degree pre-prisms, and responded very
accurately post-prisms (Figure \ref{fig_TE}). As a result,
analysis was done both with and without including Patient 27, and
results did not differ.  What is presented here is the data
excluding Patient 27.  An analysis of covariance was performed,
with prism condition as a fixed factor and trial duration as a
random covariate, and there was no indication of an influence of
prisms on time interval estimation ($F(1,4)= 0.79$,
$\text{p}=0.4$).

For each participant and condition, a linear model
was computed in order to yield a measure of the relationship
(slope) between time intervals and estimations. As can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig_TE}, the relationship was not recti-linear (first
order), so linear models were computed based on log-transformed
time. When this was done, linear models fit very well (13 models,
one for each participant session,
$r^2$: first quartile $=0.80$, median $=0.87$, third quartile
$=0.92$).  The worst case model was, nevertheless, still
significant ($F(1,14)=12.4$, $\text{p}< 0.01$, $r^2=0.47$),
indicating that despite their poor performance, patients'
responses were, in fact, reliably influenced by the true trial
intervals.

\begin{figure}[p]

\caption{Figure depicts both line-plots of reported interval vs.
true interval (right), and barplots that depict performance change
pre- and post-prisms, calculated as the slope of a linear model of
estimated and actual time intervals.  One patient repeated the
post-adaptation task, and both results are included here. Patient
27, the patient that did not show clinical signs of neglect at
time of testing, can be seen to exhibit a slope of near 1 (left),
indicating that estimated time intervals increase in proportion to
actual intervals, and this can be seen at right, as a nearly
diagonal line.}

### Line bisection

As a group, the neglecting patients showed a significant change in
line bisection bias after prism adaptation in the direction
traditionally seen in the research when a one-sided test was used
(Patient 27 removed, $t(4)=2.6$, $\text{p} = 0.03$).  Individual
t-tests on the sets of line bisections for each patient, with a Bonferonni
adjusted criterion ($\alpha = 0.008$), demonstrated
a relatively consistent effect across individuals. As can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig_LB_Prisms}, the changes were nearly-universally
leftward excepting Patient 27.
Patient's 95, 97, and 171 demonstrated significant leftward shifts
in bias post-prisms ($t(16)=3.3$, $\text{p} < 0.008$, $t(17)=4.1$,
$\text{p} < 0.001$, $t(18)=3.2$, $\text{p} < 0.008$,
respectively).  Patient 27 demonstrates a direction of change
opposite to what is expected, and what the rest of the
participants show, but this change is non-significant with the
Bonferonni adjusted criteria ($\alpha = 0.008$, $t(18)=-2.70$,
$\text{p} = 0.015$).  Patient 10 produced the largest average
difference in bias, but was also highly variable, and as a result,
did not demonstrate statistically significant change ($t(12)=1.9$,
$\text{p} = 0.08$).  Patient 163 clearly did not show measurable
change post-prisms ($t(10)=1.2$, $\text{p} = 0.3$).

As a group, the neglecting patients did not improve on either
bells ($t(4)=0.6$, $\text{p}=0.5$), or star cancellation
($t(4)=1.7$, $\text{p}=0.2$), and, as can be seen in Table
\ref{tbl_Prisms}, only one patient showed improvement on figure
copying (Patient 171).
