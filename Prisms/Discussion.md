[prisms influenced "dorsal"] As discussed above, prisms have
repeatedly been found to influence deficits putatively associated
with dorsal visual stream processing. Here, we replicate past
findings that prisms effect the bias present when neglect patients
perform the line bisection task [@Rossetti1998; @Striemer2010dpm], a
task that involves a motoric reporting of centre and is associated
with dorsal brain activation [@Foxe2003; @Weiss2000; @Cicek2009].
While the perception of the line itself, it could be argued, may
also involve some ventral stream perceptual processing, past
research involving a related perceptual task, the landmark task,
suggests that the neglect-induced bias observed in line bisection
probably represents a relatively clear indicator of a dorsal
deficit within the disorder [@Striemer2010dpm]. The findings here
suggest that, in at least some of the neglecting
patients, prisms did appear to bring about a shift in bisection
toward previously neglected space, replicating previous research, and
confirming the prism-induced shift of visual-motor bias in the
patients.

[SWM not remediated] The spatial working memory task, despite
being spatial in nature, is designed to primarily test for 
ventrally-oriented working memory deficits, and relies on stimuli
in central and right space, rather than left space, where the spatial
attention defects associated with neglect predominate. 
The locations of the targets need
to not only be perceived, but recalled again after a delay, and
that delay putatively causes the task to rely heavily on ventral,
working memory systems [@Ferber2006; @Milner2006].
While the patients did show
statistically significant improvement as a group on the spatial 
working memory task after prism adaptation, the
change left all four neglecting patients with apparent deficits. 
Post prisms, three out of four
performed well outside of what would be expected 
in a previously studied control population.

[TE also not improved] Even more prominently than the spatial working memory results,
neglect patients displayed severe deficits on the temporal
estimation task. While responses did seem to be influenced by the
actual trial duration (i.e., larger estimates were made for longer
actual interval durations), the patients underestimated the durations
both before and after prisms. In this case, prisms
failed to produce any measurable effect on the deficit.

[concluding] Neglect is a disorder arising from naturally varied
brain lesions, and which produces heterogeneous deficits that can
range from mild to severe and can recover over time in less than
predictable degrees. As a result, there are going to be
limitations to what can be inferred from treatment-effect studies
like this when sample sizes are necessarily small.  However, 
this chapter demonstrated that prisms can produce significant and
relatively reliable change the the line bisection performance,
while at the same time, failing to meaningfully ameliorate
performance on the other domains that putatively rely on, ventral
stream processing. This lack of
meaningful improvement fits the prediction that prisms --- a
treatment demonstrated in the past to influence primarily dorsal brain
regions --- would have minimal effects on the deficits of working
memory and time perception because they rely
on ventral networks. These findings lend support to
the hypothesis presented earlier, that neglect is a disorder
impacting two independent
systems, and that remediation of only dorsal functioning will have minimal
effect on the ventral deficits. More effective
treatments, therefore, will necessarily need to produce changes in the
behaviours attributable to ventral perceptual system function.
