Prism adaptation does not improve deficits in spatial working memory or temporal estimation.
============================================================================================

The previous chapter demonstrated that the working memory deficits
observed in neglect are not specific to spatial working memory,
and therefore cannot be reduced to a simple consequence of spatial
attention. This working memory deficit joins several perceptual
deficits discovered in neglect to highlight an independent, subtle
but debilitating, set of deficits that stand apart from the
traditionally described deficits of spatial attention.

[Prisms remediate spatial attention] As discussed earlier, one of
the most promising and well studied treatments for the remediation
of neglect is the use of short term adaptation to leftward
shifting prisms [tk]. Much of the research into prism adaptation
has focused on the striking changes in spatial attention,
demonstrating a shift from completely ignoring stimuli left of
centre, to attending almost equally to leftward as rightward
stimuli [one or more of Striemer & Danckert, 2007; Nijboer et al.,
Schindler et al., 2008]. Interestingly, at least one prism
adaptation paper failed to demonstrate what seems consistent and
reliable elsewhere. While most of the research investigating the
effects of prism adaptation on spatial attention utilize tasks
such as covert orienting or tk, @Morristk used a visual search
paradigm, and was unable to demonstrate any benefits of prism
adaptation [@Morristk].

[VS is somewhat perceptual] Serial visual search involves
successive steps that make use of more than a single system. There
is the perceptual judgment of stimuli identity that determines
progress in the search, for instance. While patients don't seem to
have trouble discerning the stimuli types used in visual search,
eye-tracking research has demonstrated that even young, healthy,
individuals fixate but fail to identify targets occasionally [tk],
so reduced perceptual judgment could play a role in diminishing
performance. That diminished performance could also come from the
search algorithm. People don't search targets in a completely
random order, so spatial working memory must play some role in
directing search based on previous locations. Further, the
revisiting behaviour observed when neglect patients perform object
cancellation [tk] hints that their search pattern for visual
search may be working memory impaired

[Prisms influence dorsal stream] The reliable effect of prisms on
remediating spatial attention deficits, with their simultaneous
lack of obvious efficacy on more perceptually demanding tasks and
visual search, a working memory loaded task, indicate that their
effect may be primarily on the dorsal visual stream. The two
visual stream hypothesis places spatial attention and action
(where and how) in the dorsal stream, passing from visual areas in
occipital cortex into much of the parietal lobe [tk]. Conversely,
it places perception, and working memory of those perceptions, in
the ventral stream, radiating into the temporal lobe [sametk].
Various lines of research have pointed to prisms specifically
effecting dorsal areas. @Danckert2008 and @Clower1996 have both
demonstrated "dorsal stream" activation during prism adaptation,
with fMRI and PET respectively. Both studies found activation in
the intraparietal sulcus. @Danckert2008 also found anterior
cingulate and cerebellar activation, but neither study identified
activation in ventral stream areas.

[Neglect SA/Prisms recovery associated with parietal cortex] Some
research into the specific neural correlates of prisms in neglect.
@Luatei2006 found that several areas correlated with the
effectiveness of prisms at remediating neglect symptoms using PET.
They found an extensive cluster of areas, which included posterior
parietal cortex [@Luate2006]. An examination of task-evoked brain
activity during recovery from neglect corroborates this notion.
Participants performing a covert orienting task while undergoing
fMRI imaging exhibited significantly attenuated activity in
undamaged areas of visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex
(particularly the intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal
lobule), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [@Corbetta2005].

[Hypothesis] The effects of prisms appear to be highly specific to
the dorsal, spatial attention deficits in neglect, and yet, as
highlighted in the previous chapter, there does appear to be
significant deficits that can be characterized as primarily
loading the ventral visual system in neglect (i.e., visual and
spatial working memory [Ch.1., tk], perceptual judgments of
spatial extent [tk], or emotional expression [tk], among others).
This chapter explores the influence of prisms on two functions
shown to be impaired in neglect, and chosen because they
demonstrate impairments in a neglect patient's ability to maintain
accurate perceptual representations of his or her environment. The
effect of prisms on spatial working memory and temporal perception
were examined. Both spatial working memory and temporal perception
are predominantly tasks of perception, and likely be supported by
mechanisms primarily located in the ventral stream. As such, we
expected to find neglect patients would continue to demonstrate
deficits in these two tasks even after prism adaptation. More
precisely, we expected to show prisms simultaneously benefit
dorsal stream tasks, like the clinical line-bisection measure, but
not perception-dominant tasks, like spatial working memory or
temporal perception.
