# Prism adaptation does not improve deficits in spatial working memory or temporal estimation.

The previous chapter demonstrated….

[att and WM unrelated]

Prism adaptation has been shown to improve spatial attention in neglect
(Striemer & Danckert, 2007; Nijboer et al., Schindler et al., 2008).

\
\

Interestingly, at least one prism adaptation paper failed to demonstrate
any benefits on a different classic measure of spatial attention – the
visual search paradigm (Morris et al., ).

[expand upon this by suggesting the visual search in not just deployment
of spatial attention but also requires WM]

\
\

It may be the case that prisms influence mechanisms supported by the
dorsal visual stream…

[brief outline of the two streams hypothesis; evidence for prisms being
a dorsal function – Danckert et al., 2008 fMRI evidence; Corbetta and
Shulman review suggesting voluntary attention is superior parietal;
Clower et al., 1996 PET study; 2000’s retroviral in monkeys – shows
connection between cerebellum and AIP; Luaute et al., fMRI of recovery
showing superior parietal activation – Corbetta has this too.]

\

This chapter explores the influence of prisms on two functions shown to
be impaired in neglect – spatial working memory and temporal perception
– to determine whether these more perceptually driven tasks will be
influenced by adaptation.

[Hyp: WM and temporal perception are important for accurate construction
of perceptual representations – therefore, they are likely to rely to a
greater extent on ventral stream processing and as such will show little
benefit from prisms]
