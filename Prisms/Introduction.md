Prism adaptation does not improve deficits in spatial working memory or temporal estimation.
============================================================================================

The previous chapter demonstrated that the working memory deficits
observed in neglect are not specific to spatial working memory,
and therefore cannot be reduced to a simple consequence of spatial
attention. This working memory deficit joins several perceptual
deficits discovered in neglect to highlight an independent, subtle
but debilitating, set of deficits that stand apart from the
traditionally described deficits of spatial attention.

[Prisms remediate spatial attention] As discussed earlier, one of
the most promising and well studied treatments for the remediation
of neglect is the use of short term adaptation to leftward
shifting prisms [@Rossetti1998, @Luaute2006]. Much of the research
into prism adaptation has focused on the striking changes in
spatial attention, demonstrating a shift from completely ignoring
stimuli left of centre, to attending almost equally to leftward as
rightward stimuli [@Striemer2007, @Nijboer2008, @Schindler2008].
Interestingly, at least one prism adaptation study failed to
demonstrate what seems consistent and reliable elsewhere. While
most of the research investigating the effects of prism adaptation
on spatial attention utilize tasks such as covert orienting,
@Morris2004 used a visual search paradigm, and was unable to
demonstrate any benefits of prism adaptation [@Morris2004].

[VS is somewhat perceptual] Serial visual search involves
successive steps that make use of more than a single system. There
is the perceptual judgment of stimulus identity that determines
progress in the search, for instance. While patients do not seem
to have trouble discerning the stimulus types used in visual
search, eye-tracking research has demonstrated that even young,
healthy, individuals can occasionally fixate, or even interact
with targets, but still fail to identify them [@Rich2008,
@Solman2011], so reduced perceptual judgment can play a role in
diminished search performance.  That diminished performance could
also come from the search algorithm itself.  People do not search
targets in a completely random order, necessitating a role for
spatial working memory in directing search based on previously
visited locations.  Further, the revisiting behaviour observed
when neglect patients perform object cancellation tasks suggests
that their search patterns may be indicative of impaired working
memory [@Wojciulik2001, @Husain2001]. 

[Prisms influence dorsal stream] The reliable effect of prisms on
remediating spatial attention deficits, with their simultaneous
lack of obvious efficacy on more perceptually demanding tasks and
visual search, a working memory loaded task, indicate that their
effect may be primarily on the dorsal visual stream. The two
visual stream hypothesis places spatial attention and action
(where and how) within the dorsal stream, passing from visual
areas in occipital cortex into much of the parietal lobe
[@Milner2006vba].  Conversely, it places perception, and working
memory of those perceptions, in the ventral stream, radiating into
the temporal lobe [@Milner2006vba].  Various lines of research
have pointed to prisms specifically effecting dorsal areas.
@Danckert2008 and @Clower1996 have both demonstrated "dorsal
stream" activation during prism adaptation, with fMRI and PET
respectively. Both studies found activation in the intraparietal
sulcus.  @Danckert2008 also found anterior cingulate and
cerebellar activation, but neither study identified activation in
ventral stream areas.

[Neglect SA/Prisms recovery associated with parietal cortex]
@Luatei2006 found that several areas correlated with the
effectiveness of prisms at remediating neglect symptoms using PET.
They found an extensive cluster of areas, which included posterior
parietal cortex [@Luate2006]. An examination of task-evoked brain
activity during recovery from neglect corroborates this notion.
Participants performing a covert orienting task while undergoing
fMRI exhibited significantly attenuated activity in undamaged
areas of visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex (particularly
the intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal lobule), and
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [@Corbetta2005].

[Hypothesis] Thus the effects of prisms appear to be highly
specific to the dorsal stream and to spatial attention deficits in
neglect, and yet, as highlighted in the previous chapter, there
are significant deficits that can be characterized as primarily
loading the ventral visual system in neglect. For example, visual
and spatial working memory [Ch.1., @Wojciulik2001, @Striemer2013],
perceptual judgments of spatial extent [@Dijkerman2003,
@Striemer2010dpm], or emotional expression [@Ferber2003,
@Sarri2006], among others.  This chapter explores the influence of
prisms on two functions shown to be impaired in neglect, and
chosen because they demonstrate impairments in a neglect patient's
ability to maintain accurate perceptual representations of his or
her environment. The effect of prisms on spatial working memory
and temporal perception were examined. Both spatial working memory
and temporal perception are predominantly tasks of perception, and
likely to be supported by mechanisms primarily located in the
ventral stream. As such, we expected to find neglect patients
would continue to demonstrate deficits in these two tasks even
after prism adaptation. More precisely, we expected to show prisms
simultaneously benefit dorsal stream tasks, such as the clinical
line-bisection measure, but not perception-dominant tasks, such as
spatial working memory or temporal perception.
