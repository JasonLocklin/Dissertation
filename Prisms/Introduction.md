Prism adaptation does not improve deficits in spatial working memory or temporal estimation.
============================================================================================

The previous chapter demonstrated that the working memory deficits
observed in neglect are not constrained strictly to an
inability to utilize spatial attention.
This working memory deficit joins several perceptual
deficits demonstrated in neglect that stand apart from the
traditionally described deficits of spatial attention [@Awh2001].

[Prisms remediate spatial attention] As discussed earlier, one of
the most promising and well studied treatments for the remediation
of neglect is the use of short term adaptation to leftward
shifting prisms [@Rossetti1998; @Luaute2006]. While much of the
research into prism adaptation has focused on changes in spatial
attention [@Striemer2007; @Nijboer2008; @Schindler2008], their
effectiveness may not extend to more integrated, perceptual tasks
such as serial visual search [@Morris2004].

Visual search involves successive steps that make use of
several systems, including both perception and working memory.
While patients do not seem
to have trouble discerning the stimulus types used in visual
search, eye-tracking research has demonstrated that even young,
healthy, individuals can occasionally fixate, or even interact
with targets, but still fail to identify them [@Rich2008;
@Solman2012], highlighting that reduced perceptual
judgment can play a role in search performance.  

Diminished performance could
also come from the search algorithm itself.  People do not search
targets in a completely random order, necessitating a role for
working memory in directing search based on previously
visited locations. Patients with neglect often exhibit revisiting behaviours, 
returning to previously checked items repeatedly throughout the task. This may be the
result of working memory deficits, as patients may fail
to maintain accurate representations of progress across time
[@Wojciulik2001; @Husain2001].
The visual search task is both a spatial task and one of serial behaviour ---
searching from one location to another over time ---
and so both the spatial working memory deficits discussed earlier, as well as
deficits impacting time perception [@Danckert2007] could account for the behaviour.  




[Prisms influence dorsal stream] The effect of prisms on
remediating spatial attention deficits, along with the simultaneous
lack of obvious efficacy on perceptual and search tasks,
indicate that their target of action may be primarily within the dorsal visual
stream.  The two visual stream hypothesis places spatial attention
and action (where and how) within the dorsal stream, passing from
visual areas in occipital cortex into superior regions of the parietal lobe
[@Milner2006].  Conversely, it places perception, and working
memory of those perceptions, in the ventral stream, radiating into
the temporal lobe [@Milner2006].  Various lines of research have
pointed to prisms specifically affecting dorsal areas.
@Danckert2008 and Clower and colleagues (\citeyear{Clower1996}) have
both demonstrated dorsal
stream activation during prism adaptation, with fMRI and PET
respectively. Both studies found activation in the intraparietal
sulcus. @Danckert2008 also found anterior cingulate and
cerebellar activation, but neither study identified activation in
ventral stream areas.

[Neglect SA/Prisms recovery associated with parietal cortex]
Luaute and colleagues (\citeyear{Luaute2006})
found that several areas correlated with the
effectiveness of prisms at remediating neglect symptoms using PET.
They found an extensive cluster of areas, which included posterior
parietal cortex [@Luaute2006]. An examination of task-evoked brain
activity during recovery from neglect corroborates this notion.
Participants performing a covert orienting task while undergoing
fMRI exhibited significantly attenuated activity in undamaged
areas of visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex (particularly
the intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal lobule), and
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [@Corbetta2005].

[Hypothesis] Thus the effects of prisms appear to be highly
specific to the dorsal stream and to spatial attention deficits in
neglect, and yet, as highlighted in the previous chapter, there
are significant deficits that can be characterized as primarily
involving perception and hence the ventral visual system.
For example, visual
and spatial working memory [Ch.2.; @Wojciulik2001; @Striemer2013],
perceptual judgments of spatial extent [@Dijkerman2003;
@Striemer2010dpm], or emotional expression [@Ferber2003;
@Sarri2006], among others, are not altered following prism
adaptation.  This chapter explores the influence of
prisms on two functions shown to be impaired in neglect ---
spatial working memory and temporal perception
[@Wojciulik2001; @Striemer2013; @Danckert2007].
These two domains were
chosen because they demonstrate impairments in a neglect patient's
ability to maintain accurate perceptual representations of his or
her environment. Both spatial working memory
and temporal perception are
likely to be supported by mechanisms primarily located in the
ventral stream [@Milner2006]. As such, we expected to find neglect patients
would continue to demonstrate deficits in these two tasks even
after prism adaptation. More precisely, we expect prisms
would remediate dorsal stream tasks, such as the clinical
line-bisection measure, but not perception-dominant tasks, such as
spatial working memory or temporal perception.
