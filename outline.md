Eye movement and Perception
========================

Saccades are precise motor movements that are usually programmed to
move the eyes to foviate a specific target. Saccadic supression, and the
speed limitations of retinal cells, prevent visual information from
reaching the brain during the movement [@Matin1982], and thus the brain
from making on-line motor corrections, and yet, the eyes land reliably
close to the target most of the time. This ability to execute a
pre-programmed motor movement with extreme precision, reliably, and
maintain that ability over a lifetime, despite operating, essentially
"blind," is a testement to one or more highly capable underlying
control systems.


[accuracy is maintained through adaptation] Any motor system must
incorporate a realistic expectation of inaccuracy, and perform in
way that minimises consequences. Because on-line feedback is not
available in this particular case, the visual motor system is forced
to rely on information gleaned after-the-fact, or, in other words,
"error signals," to maintain effective control mechanism parameters
[@Wong2010]. There exists a rich, half-century of investigation into
this short-term parametric adaptation of saccades, or simply
"saccadic adaptation," based on the origional paradigm developed by
@mclaughlin1967. Saccaddic adaptation tasks mimick and amplify
oculomotor processes that occur naturally and on a continual basis
in humans. For example, neuromuscular changes, such as a changes in
the strength and funciton paresis of ocular muscles due to paresis,
injury [@Kommerell1976], or aging [@warabi1984], or the wearing of
magnifying glasses [@Erkelens1989], result in some saccadic error,
and the neuroplasticity underlying saccadic adaptation permit
correction so that vision is not impaired. These types of
purturbations can be monocular or binocular [@Erkelens1989] and can
effect saccadic accuracy in various dimensions[@Chaturvedi1997].

[SA is motoric, but also perception -compare with prisms] From the
earliest discussion, saccadic adaptation has been compared to prism
adaptation and other examples of sensory-motor neural plasticity
[@mclaughlin1967]. Two characteristics make it unique. First, as
mentioned above, unlike other adaptive systems, saccadic adaptation is
unable to rely on feedback, due to the saccadic supression. Second, it
straddles the perceptual and motor systems in a highly unique way.
Saccadic adaptation *is* a form of sensory adaptation, because it
changes the way the environment is percieved. Vision is entirely
dependent on where the eyes look, so when eye movements change, the
input to the visual systems are directly changes. At the same time
saccadic adaptation *is* motor adaptation, as it is fundamentally the
parameters of motor movements, not sensitivity, that is adapted. Prisms
are simmilar, but involve different systems. While SA effects the motor
plan to execute a saccade to a particular point in a person's visual
periphery, Prisms don't change eye movements. Instead, they shift the
ocular position of "straight ahead" in body-centric terms.


[SA involves a complicated set of mechanisms] It would be easy to
assume that saccadic adaptation occurs by the integration of a
relatively simple "error signal" into a type of universal saccadic
"gain" parameter. Ultimately, this does not appear to be the case.
There is, in fact, more than one type of error signal that the brain
could make use of, from motor afferent signals and the visual
system, as well as several possible parametric ways of changing
saccade amplitude [@Lappe2009]. This complex set of features make
saccadic adaptation an interesting way to investigate functional
plasticity mechanisms in the brain, and provides a clear contrast
with prisms, for which the updating mechanisms are not functionally
equivelant. This comparable, but functionally different response to
saccadic relative to prism adaptation may provide a profitable
avenue for investigating, or even ameliorating the assymetrical
attention problems in people with Unilateral Neglect or other
related disorders.



### Volitional and Reactive Saccades are Distinct

Saccades, generally, can be subdivided into two types based on
function. Humans and most other visual animals respond to sudden
changes in peripheral space by orienting, and typically foviating the
stimuli. This is necessisary in humans because of impoverished retinal
resolution and perceptual information processing in the visual
periphery. The need to quickly assess environmental changes provides a
universal drive to orients accuratly and quickly toward such stimuli,
with little top-down interference.

In contrast, self-directed investigation of an environment by
goal-directed, internally initiated saccades, such as in visual
search, requires a somewhat different strategy. Such saccades are,
by definition, going to involve a greater degree of entanglement
with conscious goal-monitoring mechanisms, and other high-level
cognitive systems. As such, unlike reactive saccades, these
voluntary saccades are very likely to involve move extensive
functional brain areas, and exhibit somewhat different
characteristics. Besides different functional brain structures,
volitional and reactive saccades, also called targetting and express
saccades, respectively in the literature, present different
behavioral characteristics. For example, reactive saccades exhibit
very short latencies when compared with volitional saccades
[@Alahyane2007].


#### Different Systems.

Saccades triggered by exogenous cues, like a sudden movement or
appearance of an object in the periphery are considered reactive
saccades and are typically contrasted with voluntary saccades.
Voluntary saccades are the type of normal eye movements performed
based on the execution and monitoring of internal goals like
searching for an object or monitoring the progress of a manual task.
While this destinction doesn't appear to bear out in the cerebellum,
it does seem to explain a degree of functional specialization in the
oculomotor areas of the cerebral cortex [@Schraa-Tam2009,@MÃ¼ri2008].
As a result, it's valuable to keep in mind the destinction when
comparing results from experiments which may be utilizing different
saccade types, and when atempting to extrapolate mechanistic models
based on simple reactive saccades to more naturalistic behaviour.



#### Divergent Characteristics

Papers examining the differing mechanisms (but not neural substrates)
between reactive and voluntary saccades [@Alahyane2007, @Collins2006,
@Cotti2007, @Cotti2009, @Deubel1995, @Erkelens1993, @Fujita2002,
@Zimmermann2009].


An appreciation for the behavioral and functional differences between
voluntary and reactive saccades should inform any discussion of
saccadic adaptation. Most research into saccadic adaptation involves
the adaptation of reactive saccades, and there is a danger of
overgeneralizing results from this work to all eye movements.
Results from the adaptation of volitional saccades, or better yet, from
research involving both types of saccades, are always going to give a
more reliable picture of the mechanics of maintaining the effectiveness
of voluntary eye movements.


Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------

### Adaptation is not generalized

[position and direction specificity] Some of the most reliable
characteristics found when investigating saccadic adaptation are
direction and magnitude specificity. While adaptation seems to
generalize to any starting eye position, only saccades simmilar to
the trained vector direction and magnitude show effects
[@Miller1981;@Frens1994;Noto1999;@Alahyane2004;@Alahyane2003].
Interestingly, the same lack of transfer can be found from one point
to another at a different depth in 3D peripersonal space
[@Chaturvedi1997]. Others have found that when addapted in one
meridian, there is limited transfer to others [Lemij1992]. There
also seems to be nearly strict independence of horizontal and
vertical adaptation [@Watanabe2003]. Adaptation of a particular
saccade amplitude do not generalize to other amplitudes
[@Miller1981;@Frens1994;@Albano1996;@Straube1997]. And, perhapse the
most reliable and long-observed specificity is directional. When,
for example, leftward saccades are augmented or reduced with
saccadic adaptation, rightward saccades are uneffected, regardless
of the spatial position overlap [@Deubel1986;@Frens1994;@Albano1996].


[Rather than cartesian specificity, spatial reference frames] The
different dimensions of adaptation described above can be re-phrased
in terms of spatial reference frames. Particular locations in
retinal space could be considered orbitocentric or retinocentric,
depending on whether starting postion matters, while directional
effects, or differences between saccade reduction and augmentation
can be thought of as oculocentric. Saccadic adaptation seems to
function in a way that is primarily retina-referenced, rather than
an orbitocentric [@Albano1996]

@Albano1996 had participants observe targets as they were displaced
horizontally across a computer scree, and indicate whenever the target
dimmed. The final position of one trial became the starting position of
the next, so that to the participant, the target seemingly moved
randomly back and forth across the screen. Intrasaccadic target
displacements were made in order to induce saccadic adaptation. They
were always horizontal, and when they occured, always a 40 percent
change, either more or less than the initial saccadic distance at the
beginning of the trial. The resulting data



#### Augmentation and reduction are probably uniquely specialized.

[+-gain is important distinction]Probably the most extensively
studied dichotomy(?) of saccade adaptation is the difference between
tasks that lengthen or shorten saccades. Over the storried history
of research into the distinction, it has been referred to as
augmentation and reduction, outward and inward adaptation, forward
and backward adaptation, as well as potentiation and depression.
Regardless of the terminology, the systematic intrasaccadic
perterbation is nevertheless designed to cause either over-shooting
or under-shooting of saccades relative to the targets, and over the
course of training, inducing hypometria or hypermetria of saccades,
even later, in the absense of further target purturbations. Most
saccadic adaptation research involves only one type, but experiments
comparing the two have found  that saccadic augmentation and
reduction may involve distinct, or at least partially destinct,
mechanisms, exhibit different behavioral characteristics, and serve
somewhat different functions [@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Hernandez2008,
@PanouillÃ¨res2009, @PanouillÃ¨res2012].

[Distinct systems]Exeperiments that have examined both backward and
forward adaptation have found that backward adaptation is
considerably more robust, occuring in fewer trials, and is more
reliable from person to person [for a review, see @Hopp2004]. They
also appear reflect structurally unique systems. For instance,
@PanouillÃ¨res2009 adapted participants either forward or backward,
and had them perform antisaccades toward the adapted location. While
most participants adapted to their assigned conditions (5 of 19 in
the forward condition did not), only the backward adapted
participants exhibited transfer to antisaccades. This hints that
backward adaptation is occuring after the mechanism required for
saccade inversion, while forward adaptation may not. Furthermore,
@PanouillÃ¨res2012 followed up with Transcranial Magnetic
Stimuliation (TMS) of the lateral cerebellum during the adaptation
phase of both adaptive lengthening and shortening of saccades. The
result was a potentiation of adaptive lengthening, and and a
depression, and near elimination, of saccadic shortening, providing
a neuroanatomical dissasociation between the two [@PanouillÃ¨res2012]
. Cellular recording of primates seems to support this notion of
divergent neuroanatomy for the two types of adaptation. For
instance, the population response of Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum seems to encode or influence the duration of normal and
gain-increased saccades, but not gain-decreased saccades [@Catz2008].

[Why? Shortening is fatigue and may be special] There are a variety
of reasons for oculomotor systems to become more error-prone. One
particular, natural, cause, is both likely to be both ever-present
and unidirectional in the error it produces. Muscular fatigue is
presumably a major contributor to an organism's need for adaptive
mechanisms. Unlike, for example, damage to a particular muscle, or
other biomechanical changes, fatigue is always going to reduce
saccadic amplitude, regardless of the direction of the saccade. It
stands to reason that a "fatigue coping" system, because it is going
to be continually engaged, may be different in some ways than the
mechanisms for lengthening, or augmenting, saccades over time. In
fact, its possible that part or even all of saccadic reduction could
be accounted for by uncomponsated fatigue. Backward purturbations
remove the error signal that engages anti-fatigue adaptation, and as
a result, saccades may shorten as a result of fatigue rather than
any particular active adaptive mechanisms. Beyond that, for whatever
reason, normal saccades are hypometric [@Wong2012]. As a result,
backward adaptation is unique in that occurs with target
purturbations that either reduce the "error" in foviating the target
stimulus, or actually reverse the typical error signal by producing
an artificially hypermetric saccade.

[Vermal patients cant compensate for fatigue or adapt to SA]
@Golla2008 tested controls and patients with cerebellar damage on a
saccadic adaptation task involving both augmented and shortened
saccades. The controls, and two patients with an intact oculomotor
vermis, but large, unilateral hemispheric lesions, adapted to the
augmentation by increasing saccade durration, but not peak velocity.
They adapted to inward adaptation, in a different manner by
exhibiting changes both parameters. In contrast, patients with
damage to the oculomotor vermis exhibited a complete extinction of
outward adaptation, and a partal loss of inward adaptation.
Tellingly, they were also unable to reliably saccade to un-purturbed
targets over time as well. They exhibited a lack of resiliance when
asked to saccade to fixed targets repeatedly. Their saccades to
these steady-state targets decreased in duration, producing saccades
which were more and more hypometric as the task went on [@Golla2008]
. This does not appear to the result of an unprocessed error, as
these poorer and poorer saccades were followed by a necissary
increase in corrective saccades [@Golla2008]. Instead, when taken
together, the selective, partial retention of inward adaptation and
the gradual shortening of saccades to static targets indicate that
rather than active adaptation, these participants are simply failing
to adequately compensate for fatigue of some sort.



### Structure of an adaptive system

[Structure of SA comes heavily from animal studies]While variants of
the standard target-purturbation based paradigm are the base of
research investigating saccadic adaptation, much of the information
about the structural functionality maintaining saccadic accuracy
come from the effects of lesions or other neural dysfunction, and
animal research. Saccadic adaptation is an important low-level
function of mammilian visual systems, which all have imperfect
ability to produce accurate muscular torque over time, and imperfect
perceptual abilities, so animal research can provide a great deal of
insight. Two approaches to study sacccadic adapation in animals have
typically been used. The more common procedure of purturbing targets
durring the perceptual blindness of a saccade, and the lesioning of
extraocular muscles in monkeys [@Optican1980; @Scudder1998].





#### Cerebellum is key to maintaining reactive saccades

[Cerebellum=control] Saccadic adaptation is actually one of a set of
adaptation methodologies that has been central to understanding the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is a key area for movement control and
sensory-motor plasticity [@Glickstein2011]. A full analysis of what is
known about the neural substrates of saccadic adaptation in the
cerebellum would be beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, the
vast majority of neuroscience research investigating saccadic
adaptation has investigeted, and in-fact implicated, structures in the
cerebellum as being either involved-in or directly responsible for the
learning the new oculomotor parameters.  For more extensive reviews,
see @Iwamoto2010 and @Pelisson2010.

[damage leads to loss of control] People with damage to the
cerebellum are typically cheracterized as having loss of movement
coordination, or "ataxia" of one movement type or another. A more
nuanced view, though reveals two very basic deficits. First,
movement precision is poor, with delayed and inappropriate
corrections producing oscillations, or "intention tremors",
especially for multi-joint complex actions [@Diedrichsen2013].
Secondly, and more directly relevant to the discussion of saccadic
adaptation, they typically fail to respond to feedback like that of
saccadic adaptation. The intention tremors seem to be related to an
ineffective or delayed use of sensory feedback, as it is reduced or
absent when patients point to targets with their eyes closed
[@Day1998].

[including in SA] Further, cerebellar damage seems to cause
a variety of oculomotor deficits, including dysmetria of saccadic eye
movements, and Nystagmus, an involentary eye movement consisting of
slow drift and fast resetting phases, as well as an abnormal
vestible-occular reflex [@Diedrichsen2013]. People with syndromes
associated with serebellar dysfunction also show impaired saccadic
adaptation [@Waespe1992]. Similarily, in monkeys, targeted damage to
the cerebellum (Oculomotor cerebellar vermis, fastigial nuclei) can
nearly eliminate the ability to adapt saccades [@Optican1980;
@Goldberg1993; @Takagi1998; @Barash1999]

[Certain regions in particular] Medial, posterior, cerebellum (vermis
and fastigial nuclei) is thought to be central in the control of
accuracy and adaptive calibration of saccadic eye movements [for
reviews see: @Hopp2004, @PÃ©lisson2003, @PÃ©lisson2010]. For example,
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the medioposterior
cerebellum has been shown to produce an inhibitory effect on saccadic
adaptation [@Jenkinson2010]. Evidence for the role of other areas of
the cerebellum is much more sporadic and and difficult to glean a
clear-cut role from. Deficits of saccadic adaptation observed in humans
with cerebellar lesions suggest possible importance of lateral
structures [@Alahyane2008, @Choi2008, @Golla2008, Straube2001]. Some
electophysiological studies [@Mano1991, @Ron1973] and imaging studies
[@Dieterich2000, @Schraa-Tam2009] have hinted at other
parts of the cerrebellum being involved in the control of saccades


[The Cerebellum is doing...] The cerebellum hints at a temptingly
universal function, ocassionally affectionately reffered to as the
cerrebellar transform. It's recursive connectivity with motor, sensory
and other areas of the cortex as well as brainstem and direct spinal
pathways, as well as it's universal-seeming motor-refining abilities,
and uniform but modulear histological structure, hint at a general
function applied to a wide range of motor actions. Unfortunately, the
exact nature of this "cerrebellar transform" is a longstanding problem
in neuroscience, and goes far beyond what can be discussed here. In
brief, it may serve as a "predictive forward model" builder for motor
control [@Maill1998], or provide the input to build such models if they
happen to be located elsewhere in the cortex. Alternatively, the more
classical description of cerrebellar function is that of error-based
learning [@Marr1969;@Albus1971] origionally described a computational
model of error-based learning in the cerebellar cortex, and that idea
of error-based learning has been adopted as a central notion in
research into the cerebellum to date.  Unfortunately, the Marr-Albus
theories, while recognizing the apparent need for an "error-signal" to
drive neuromotor learning, provide only a rudimentary idea of the type
and function of that error [see @Highstein2005 for a more recent
discussion]. The contemporary idea of error-based learning is based on
the comparison of predicted and actual sensory movement outcomes.
Crucually, it is the signed difference between those outcomes that is
capable of providing the impetus for a lasting parametric adaptation
[@Tseng2007].

[Not so simple] Cerebellar lesions can also effectively eliminate prism
adaptation, both in terms of corrections to movements while wearing
prisms, and any aftereffects [@Martin1996]. Simmilar results have been
found with adapting pointing movements to a force field or
purturbations produced by a robot arm [@Maschke2004;@Smith2005], gait
adaptation to a split-belt treadmill [@Morton2006], and reaching under
novel visuomotor transformations [@Tseng2007]. Saccadic adaptation is
thus one of many sensorimotor adaptations that seem to require the
cerebellum [@Golla2008, @Prsa2011]. However, even this finding may be
influenced by other oculomotor deficits. For example, some resarchers
have found hypometria but unimpaired saccadic adaptation in patients
with diffuse cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar infarction [@Choi2008].
The picture is likely far more complex than the cerebelluum, and almost
certainly involves a complex interplay with other structures, like the
superior colliculus and cortical areas.

##### Cerebellar Vermis and lateral structures

[Cerebellar regions that contribute to SA]The cerebellum is far
from a homogenous structure, and so considerable research has
examined the functional anatomy of cerebellar sub-structures. The
cerebellar vermis, and more specifically, the vermal lobuli VI and
VII, commonly called the posterior, or oculomotor vermis, is
probably the best studied and well known contributor to the control
of saccadic eye movements. Purkinje cells in this area are sensitive
to eye position and, as a population, encode saccade parameters like
saccade timing and direction [@Thier2002].


[medio-posterior cerebellum is primary candidate] There is
substantial support indicating that that the medio-posterior
cerebellum, which includes the above mentioned oculomotor vermis,
plus the caudal part of the fastigial nucleus, contributes to
saccadic adaptation, or, at minimum, backward adaptation of reactive
saccades
[@HoppFuchs2004,@IwamotoKaku2010,@PÃ©lisson2010,PrsaThier2011,Tian2009]
. For example, patients with lesions of the cerebellar vermis
[@Golla2008], or with a neurodegenerative desease which happens to
primarily damage the Purkinje cells of the vermis [@Xu-Wilson2009]
are unresponsive to backward saccadic adaptation. TODO: Further
evidence provided by [@Desmurget1998,@Jenkinson2010] if necissary.

[However, lateral areas may also play a part] It also requires
mentioning that there is some evidence of involvement of other parts
of the cerebellum in the adaptation of reactive saccades.
@PanouillÃ¨res2012 was able to modify reactive saccade adaptation
with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the hemispheric lobule
Crus I. Others have found further hints of hemispheric involvement
[@Alahyane2008,@Choi2008,@Straube2001,@Broekhoven2009].


[TMS of lat. cerbellum affects SA in complex ways] In order to
investigate the involvement of lateral cerebellum, @PanouillÃ¨res2012
found that TMS over the human left Crus I of the cerebellum after
saccade detection had a dual effect on saccadic placticity. Perhapse
paradoxically, after-effects indicated that it both reduced the
effectiveness of saccade-shortening adaptation (for saccades moving
contralateral to the stimulation), and augmented saccade-lengthening
adaptation (for saccades in both directions) [@PanouillÃ¨res2012]. In
addition to afirming lateral cerrebelum in saccadic adaptation, this
provides further evidence for distinct neural methanisms of saccadic
depression and potentiation, and hints at an antagonistic
relationship between the two. Interestingly, the authors also found
that TMS immediately at saccade-onset, rather than after a delay,
induced hypometria in that same saccade, to a small degree, but
consistantly in both directions. However, saccades with 30 or 60ms
delayed TMS were not measurably effected, however, all three
conditions lead to the after-effects described above
[@PanouillÃ¨res2012].


[Structure of Voluntary SA less studied] Much less work has been
done examining the neural substrates of the adaptation of volitional
saccades, despite the fact that these endogenous saccades are
crucial for day-to-day life. Behavioral evidence indicates that
despite the two types of saccades sharing common characteristics,
assymeticical transfer between the two indicate partially destinct
processes[@alahyane2007]. The authors postulated that saccadic
adaptation of the two structures relied on common brainstem
structures, but involved different, or perhapse overlapping,
cerebellar regions [@Alahyane2007]. @Alahyane2008 examined deficits
in two individuals undergoing both reactive and voluntary
adapatation after isolated lesions in medial and lateral parts of
the cerebellum. Saccadic adaptation to contralesional targets was
normal, however, afteraffects post adaptation to ipsilesional
targets depended on lesion location. They found a double
dissasociation, where the medial lesion degraded adaptation to
reactive saccades, but left the voluntary saccade adaptation
unhindered, while the lateral lesion left reactive saccade
adaptation functioning normally, but degraded voluntary saccadic
adaptation [@Alahyane2008].

[Not so clear, take care extrapolating reactive to voluntary] As
with the comparison of saccadic augmentation and reduction, the
relationship between the two types of saccades is far from clear,
even in the case of the cerebellar localization. Despite
@Alahyane2008 finding a double dissasociation between medial and
lateral cerebellar regions, others have found evicence that both
types of saccades activatehemispheric lobules [@Gerardin2012].
Prudence is called for when comparing, or attemptint to extrapolate
between reactive saccadic adaptation, and, for example, voluntary
scanning saccades.

FIXME: above is my terrible attempt to clarify the ambiguity
involved in using reactive saccadic adaptation with neglect patients,
who exhibit pathological scanning eye movements.



#### Colliculus drives eye movements, but is outside adaptive mechanisms

[SC is central to saccades] Because saccades can be generated by
electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus [@Fitzgibbon1986],
and because it is well connected with both the oculomotor vermis and
areas of the cortex which seem related to eye movement control and
saccadic adaptation [@Johnston2008], the superior colliculus is a
possible locus of saccadic adaptation, or at minimum, a contributing
player in a network of structures performing the adaptation.

[but adapted parameter is post SC] If the adaptable "gain" parameter is
applied to saccadic movement execution after being generated in the
superior colliculus, then the relationship between this generated
signal and the actual saccadic magnitide should be modifyable with
saccadic adaptation. While early research involving stimulation of the
DLSC of the superior colliculus of monkeys failed to find any
modulating effect of saccade adaptation [@Fitzgibbon1986; @Melis1996],
some researchers have found indications of a connection [@Edelman2002].
@Edelman2002 found that they could modify electrically evoked movements
with saccadic adaptation if the electrical stimuli were very low
current (near threshold), and even then, only when the velocity of
electrically evoked saccades was simmilar to the visually guided
saccades in the adaptation. Cell recordings off collicular motor cells
also show a remarkable consistancy in the face of behavioral saccadic
adaptation [@Goldberg1993; @Frens1997], further supporting the notion
that parametric adaptation occuring downstream of the colliculus.

[error signal is not here either]?
[SC is part of loop, but not critical to SA]?


* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp2002]
* Monkey SC activity [@Frens1997]


#### Cortical areas either contribute, or adapt in parallel

Some evidence that more than the superior colliculus / cerebellum
loop are available. Cortical frontal eye fields may be involved in
saccadic adaptation [@Frens1994; @Noto1999]...

[paralell pathways] @Melis1996 used a target-jump paradigm to
adaptively modify electrically stimulated saccades (superior
colliculus). After adaptation, only a partial transfer to visually
elicited saccades -indicating that some portion of the system was not
affected by the electrically stimulated saccades. The authors postulate
that both direct projections from both the frontal eye fields and
superior colliculus to a brainstem saccadic generator. These parallel
pathways are combined to produce parametric adaptation, and adaptation
of only a single pathway would be expected to produce only partial
adaptation of natural saccades.

[Monkey/Human & 2-pathways] This theory also indicates caution where
generalizations from monkey research are required. The weightings of
the two parallell pathways are not likely to be completely identical
between species, and with the enlarged cortical areas of the human
brain, it seems probable that the relative contributions of the cortex
may also have been changed [@Fuchs1996, @Frens1994]. This is supported
by differential findings in behavioral studies where adaptation
transfer occurs in monkeys but not humans from reactive to volitional
saccades [@Erkelens1993; @Deubel1995], eye movements to head movements
[@Kroller1996 in humans compared with @Phillips1997 and @Fuchs1996 in
monkeys]. The time course of adaptation is also much shorter in humans
[@Deubel1986; Frens1994] relative to monkeys [@Fuchs1996; Straube1997;
Scudder1998]. As with any field of research, it's debatable how much of
the monkey-human differences are due to unique neural functionaltiy,
and how much is due simply to experimental design differences required
by the different capabilities of the subjects.


* Bilateral Frontal-eye field activation during oculomotor tasks [@Paus1993].
* Cortical areas showing differential activation in primates [@Johnston2008].
* Cortical areas showing differential activation in humans [@Schraa-Tam2009].


[Cortical pathways may be vital to volitional saccades]
* @MÃ¼ri2008 provides a review of leason and TMS studies investigating cortical
dependants of volitional and reactive saccades.
* Cerebellar lesions may affect reactive saccades, but not
self-generated saccades [@Straube1995].
* Seperate neural substrates in the human cerebellum for adaptation of
reactive and voluntary saccades [@Alahyane2008].
* @PanouillÃ¨res2013 examined the cerebellar substrates of adaptive
shortening by looking for dissasociations between reactive and volitional
saccades among patients with damage to, or impaired input to (because of
Wallenberg Syndrome), regions of the cerebellum. In a study of patients
with cerebellar lesions, @PanouillÃ¨res2013 found that while damage to
the medio-posterior cerebellum does not differentially impair either
reactive or volitional saccades, damage to supero-anterior regions showed
specific deficits in the adaptation of voluntary saccades.

[and adaptation]



Functional models of adaptation
----------------------------

Examining the particularities of saccadic adaptation and the neural
functionality of it are deeply intertwined. Most of the behavioral and
psychopysisical evidence discussed in earlier sections here provide
clues about where in the perception and action systems the adaptation
may be occuring. More specifically, though, we are able to glean an
estimate of the earliest stages of vision, and the latest stages of
perception and action systems that are involved in saccadic adaptation,
providing a rough outline of the functional anatomy.


@Hopp2002 behaviorally adapted participants to either voluntary or
reactive saccades and found that to the extent that participants
retained the adaptation to the trained type, it transfered equally to
the other. This provides evidence supporting the notion that, despite
the two types of saccades involving different functional systems,
adaptation is probably happening at a shared point, like the superior
colliculus or cerebellum, rather than, for example, a cortical area.
This result was supported in a more recent replication that found
transfer between the two types of adapted saccades, but no mutual
transfer to or from adapted memory-guided saccades (saccades to
remembered target locations; @Hopp2010).

* @Fujita2005 developed a model of feed-forward associative motor
learning which works by associating the primary motor command with the
corrective motor command directly. The implication is that the motor
center and learning device share the same place-encoded information,
the motor center issues a learnign signal and motor command as one
signal, from the same unit, and the learning signal issued with a
corrective command has a heterosynaptic interaction with the previous
primary command. TODO: Find out how much traction this theory has in
the literature. If it's significant, clarify and integrate with the

Perceptual Effects of Saccadic Adaptation
-------------------------------------

### Transiant modifications of spatial perception occurs around saccade

Saccades are a motor action that has the potential for the strongest
influence on perception. Eye movements are continually responsible for
the content of what is fed to the perceptual streams, as they direct
our gaze and dictate where and when we aquire the visual information
which provides the pieces with which we construct our internal
representation of the visual world.

Further, saccades have the ability to mask large changes in the visual
scene through saccadic supression, indicating a perceptual system that
is forever subserviant, or dependant on action systems. Eyemovemnts are
strongly coupled to goal-direction actions Neggers2001GazeAnchoring.

* Brief overview of the established pre/post saccade influences
  on perception. Purpose is to demonstrate SA and perception are
  related, as well as seaway to the next section.


One way the effects of saccadic adaptation on perception may be measured
is by testing for mislocalization of targets in the adapted
field. In an early such task, @Mack1978 found that when a vertical gain
was added to horizontal saccades by purturbing lateral targets upward,
participants became decensitized to upward motion and sensitized
to downward motion. In other words, their threshold for detecting upward
motion was increased, and downward motion, decreased [@Mack1978].

* Mislocalization [@Zimmermann2009] and other recent studies.


@Hernandez2008 found that saccade lengthening (but not shortening)
transfered to pointing gestures to flashed targets. They try to account
for the effect as a combination of retinal location, sensorimotor
transform of retinal-to-extraocular muscles (of an encoded saccade), and
eye position. They postulate that the saccade lengthening adaptation
modifies TODO:understand this paper.

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane2005]


### Lasting after-affects on Perception are more subtle, but may exist

Posterior focal lesions in the cerebellum can lead to perceptual
learning deficits, as aposed to motor-learning deficits found in anterior
cerebellar lesions [@Deluca2014]. This result indicates that perceputal
learning may involve mechanisms much more closely related to motor learning,
like saccadic adaptation, than previously though.

[hints of enduring effects of SA]

* 2 basic types of enduring effects. Attention and motor transfer.


[Attention and Saccades are linked, but SA?] Immediately prior to
the initiation of an eyemovement, visual attention is directed to
the intended location. This phenominon, first described in other
terms by @Crovitz1962, is now known as the pressacadeic attention
shift [@Deubel1996,@Hoffman1995]. While the attentional system has
long been convincingly described as destinct from the saccadic motor
system [@Posner1980,@Koch1985,@Clark1999], it does not appear to be
possible to make eye movements without experiencing an associated
attentional shift [@Deubel1996,@Kowler1995], fundamentally linking
the two. It's plausible, then, that saccadic adaptation would have
cary-on effects on the deployment of attention. Unfortunately, this
potential interaction between attention and saccadic adaptation is
unclear and poorly studied. @Ditterich2000 examined this presaccadic
attention shift before and after saccadic adaptation, and was unable
to induce a change in the presaccadic attention shift location.
(FIXME: not sure if I need to nod to premotor theory ^)

[]Interestingly, @McFadden2002 found that they could directly adapt
attentional deployment in the absense of any eye movement. They cued
attention to a peripheral location, and then purturbed the cue back
toward fixation at a time interval estimated to coincide with an
attentional shift. They found that attentional shifts became
gradually reduced. They also found that when the participant was
allowed to make eye movements, the adaptation had transfered to
saccades as well [@McFadden2002]. FIXME: and this is important why?



Saccadic Adaptation for Patients with Perceptual Biases
-------------------------------------------------

[SA has untested potential for perceptual disorders] While other tasks
with simmilar heritage, like prism adaptation, have been extensively
used in clinical research applications, saccadic adaptation has
remained predominantly in the realm of psychophysics and tk (healthy
participants). There are some exceptions, mostly in disorders involving
cerebellar degeneration, but generally, the task may be an unexamined
"gold mine tk" for understanding perceptual and vision disorders.

[precident for clinical application]

* Briefly mention the use of SA in hemianopic patients [@Lvy2012] and
  abnormal eye movements during reading [@Desestret2013]

[potential future research directions]

* wide area adaptation [@Garaas2008]

* Concluding section should include possible experimental directions
  **and** drive the point home that this could be an untapped source of
  information about spatial cognition and potential clinical
  application.

* Possible controversial claim: The academic distance between
  psycho-physics (where SA has been developed) and clinical
  neuropsychology may be responsible for a research blind spot here.
  This may be a good example of the need for more interdisciplinary
  collaboration.

Scratch Space
-------------
Both the Cerebellum [@Noda1991, @Lewis1992] and the superior colliculus
[@Sparks1990; @Guitton1991] are known to be critical for the generation
of goal-directed saccades.

[Neither random purterbations nor static targets are good controls
for SA]@Desmurget2000 conducted a PET study with participants in
three conditions of saccadic adaptation (reactive saccades). The
conditions involved target perterbations occuring either
systematically (adaptation condition), randomly, or not at all
(static target). They examined three potential loci for the effects
of saccadic adaptation (i.e., a contrast of the adaptation condition
and the random condition), the frontal-eye fields, the superior
colliculus, and the oculomotor vermis area of the cerebellum. They
found evidence that the cerebellum structure was activated
differentially durring adaptation, but neither of the other two
structures. Interestingly, when comparing the saccade metrics of the
static and random conditions, they also found effects of
single-trials. So it's possible that some of the adaptive mechanisms
were equally engaged in the random condition as with the adaptive
condition. The frontal eye fields still did not become active when
comparing adaptation with the static condition, however, and this is
consistant with what other researchers have postulated, that frontal
eye fields are more specialized for voluntary, self-generated
saccades rather than the reactive saccades used in this experiment
[@Deubel1995 pp3538]. The authors also did not find superior
colliculus activity in either contrast, but are more cautious in
interpreting this null result, because of the lack of PET
sensitivity in the deep structure, and a conflicting result by
@Paus1995. Perhapse the most intreguing finding, the single-trial
effects, display an insurmountable problem in the literature.
No-purturbation controls are insufficient because they, in addition
to lacking adaptation, also lack the corrective saccades and provide
a generally much more predictible environment for the participant,
while random-purturbation controls seem to actually be impacting
adaptive systems -albeit in a way that, over the long term, produces
no systematic changes. As a result, neither control is very effective.



@Hopp2004: a slide in post-saccadic eye position has been induced by exponen-
tial motion of a full-field stimulus at the end of a saccade
(e.g., Optican and Miles, 1985; Deubel, 1991; Kapoula et al.,
1987).

@Hopp2004: SA can be induced by the wearing of
specialized prisms (Henson, 1978) or anisotropic glasses
(Lemij and Collewijn, 1991; Albano and Marrero, 1995;
Erkelens et al., 1989; Oohira et al., 1991; Bush et al., 1994;
Averbuch-Heller et al., 1999).

@Hopp2004: By analogy with such SC âmotor fieldsâ, Frens and
van Opstal (1997) named the spatial property of saccadic
adaptation an âadaptation field.â

@Hopp2004: In both monkeys and humans, a spot target that moves across
a stationary background, whether a random dot pattern, a
combination of squares and circles, or a color photo, in-
duces robust adaptation if the spot target alone undergoes
an adaptation step (Deubel, 1995a; Ditterich et al., 1999;
Robinson et al., 2000). Furthermore, in humans, adapta-
tion to a spot target with or without a background present
is statistically the same (Ditterich et al., 1999)

@Hopp2004: the focus of attention itself does
not seem to shift with saccadic adaptation. In the experi-
ments of Ditterich et al. (2000a)...
