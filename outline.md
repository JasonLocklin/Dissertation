Saccadic Adaptation and Spatial Perception
========================================

<!-- Saccades are -->

Saccades are precise motor movements that are usually programmed to
move the eyes to foviate a specific target. Saccadic supression, and the
speed limitations of retinal cells, prevent visual information from
reaching the brain during the movement [@Matin1982], and thus the brain
from making on-line motor corrections, and yet, the eyes land reliably
close to the target most of the time. This ability to execute a
pre-programmed motor movement with extreme precision, reliably, and
maintain that ability over a lifetime, despite operating, essentially
"blind," is a testement to one or more highly capable underlying
control systems.

<!-- Saccadic accuracy is maintained through adaptation -->

Any motor system must incorporate a realistic expectation of
inaccuracy, and perform in way that minimises consequences. Because
on-line feedback is not available in this particular case, the visual
motor system is forced to rely on information gleaned after-the-fact,
or, in other words, "error signals," to maintain effective control
mechanism parameters[]. There exists a rich, half-century of
investigation into this short-term parametric adaptation of saccades,
or simply "saccadic adaptation," based on the origional paradigm
developed by [@mclaughlin1967]. Saccaddic adaptation tasks mimick and
amplify oculomotor processes that occur naturally and on a continual
basis in humans. For example, neuromuscular changes, such as a paresis
of ocular muscles, or the wearing of magnifying glasses, result in some
saccadic error, and the neuroplasticity underlying saccadic adaptation
permit correction so that vision is not impaired. These types of
purturbations can be monocular or binocular [@Erkelens1989] and can
effect saccadic accuracy in various dimensions[].

<!-- SA is motoric, but also perception -compare with prisms -->

From the earliest discussion, saccadic adaptation has been compared to
prism adaptation and other examples of sensory-motor neural plasticity
[@mclaughlin1967]. Two characteristics make it unique. First, as
mentioned above, unlike other adaptive systems, saccadic adaptation is
unable to rely on feedback, due to the saccadic supression. Second, it
straddles the perceptual and motor systems in a highly unique way.
Saccadic adaptation *is* a form of sensory adaptation, because it
changes the way the environment is percieved. Vision is entirely
dependent on where the eyes look, so when eye movements change, the
input to the visual systems are directly changes. At the same time
saccadic adaptation *is* motor adaptation, as it is fundamentally the
parameters of motor movements, not sensitivity, that is adapted. Prisms
are simmilar, but involve different systems. While SA effects the motor
plan to execute a saccade to a particular point in a person's visual
periphery, Prisms don't change eye movements. Instead, they shift the
ocular position of "straight ahead" in body-centric terms.


<!-- SA involves a complicated set of mechanisms -->

It would be easy to assume that saccadic adaptation occurs by the
integration of a relatively simple "error signal" into a type of
universal saccadic "gain" parameter. Ultimately, this does not appear
to be the case. There is, in fact, more than one type of error signal
that the brain could make use of, from both motor afferent signals and
the visual system, as well as several possible parametric ways of
changing saccade amplitude []. This complex set of features make
saccadic adaptation an interesting way to investigate functional
plasticity mechanisms in the brain, and provides a clear contrast with
prisms, for which the updating mechanisms are not functionally
equivelant. This comparable, but functionally different response to
saccadic relative to prism adaptation may provide a profitable avenue
for investigating, or even ameliorating the assymetrical attention
problems in people with Unilateral Neglect or other related disorders.



Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------

TODO: Reorganize this and next section into more readable, plot sections. Each heading should summarize the section and together, they should describe the story of the section.


Some of the most reliable characteristics found when investigating
saccadic adaptation are position and direction specificity. When
saccades are adapted to targets restricted to a particular location in
retinal (2D) space, the effects do not transfer to saccades made to
distant locations [@Miller1981; @Frens1994; Noto1999; @Alahyane2004;
@Alahyane2003]. Interestingly, the same lack of transfer can be found
from one point to another in 3D peripersonal space [@Chaturvedi1997].
Others have found that when addapted in one meridian, there is little
transfer to others [Lemij1992]. There also seems to be strict
independence of horizontal and vertical adaptation [@Watanabe2003].
Adaptation of a particular saccade amplitude do not generalize to other
amplitudes [@Miller1981; @Frens1994; @Albano1996; @Straube1997]. And,
perhapse the most reliable and long-observed specificity is
directional. When, for example, leftward saccades are augmented or
reduced with saccadic adaptation, rightward saccades are uneffected,
regardless of the spatial position overlap [@Deubel1986; @Frens1994;
@Albano1996].

The different dimensions of adaptation described above can be
re-phrased in terms of spatial reference frames. Particular locations
in retinal space could be considered orbitocentric or retinocentric,
depending on whether starting postion matters, while directional
effects, or differences between saccade reduction and augmentation can
be thought of as oculocentric.

[@albano1996] had participants observe targets as they were displaced
horizontally across a computer scree, and indicate whenever the target
dimmed. The final position of one trial became the starting position of
the next, so that to the participant, the target seemingly moved
randomly back and forth across the screen. Intrasaccadic target
displacements were made in order to induce saccadic adaptation. They
were always horizontal, and when they occured, always a 40 percent
change, either more or less than the initial saccadic distance at the
beginning of the trial. The resulting data

* Spacial reference frames [@Albano1996]

* Two approaches to study sacccadic adapation have typically been used.
The more common procedure of purturbing targets durring the perceptual
blindness of a saccade, and lesioning extraocular muscles in monkeys
[@Optican1980; @Scudder1998].


* error signals influence dynamics (peak velocity) [@Straube1995], and
what does this tell us about saccadic regulation [@Ethier2008]

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane2005]
* Prediction based error signal [@Wong2012]

All of these demensions on which saccadic adaptation can apply indicate
a complex, multi-level sysetem involving various neurals structures.

#### Ractive and Volitional saccades may involve distinct systems.

Saccades triggered by exogenous cues, like a sudden movement or
appearance of an object in the periphery are considered reactive
saccades and are typically contrasted with voluntary saccades.
Voluntary saccades are the type of normal eye movements performed based
on the execution and monitoring of internal goals like searching for an
object or monitoring the progress of a manual task. While this
destinction doesn't appear to bear out in the cerebellum
[@Schraa-Tam2009!], it does seem to explain a degree of functional
specialization in the oculomotor areas of the cerebral cortex
[@Johnston2008!, @Muri2009!]. As a result, it's valuable to keep in mind
the destinction when comparing results from experiments which may be utilizing
different saccade types, and when atempting to extrapolate mechanistic
models based on simple reactive saccades to more naturalistic behaviour.

Todo: expand above paragraph into multiple paragraphs with:
* Cerebellar lesions may affect reactive saccades, but not
self-generated saccades [@Straube1995].
* In a study of patients
with cerebellar lesions, @Panouill√®res found that while damage to
the medio-posterior cerebellum does not differentially impair either
reactive or volitional saccades, damage to supero-anterior regions showed
specific deficits in the adaptation of voluntary saccades.

#### Lengthening or shortening of saccades may involve distict mechanisms

* Inward and Outward or lengthening and shortening adaptation, or
backwar and forward adaptation may involve different mechanisms, and
have different purposes. (fatigue). See @Catz2008, @Golla2008,
@Hernandez2008!, @Kojima2004!, @Panouilleres2009!, @Panouilleres2012,
@Zimmermann2009!,

@Golla2008 tested controls and patients with cerebellar damage on a
saccadic adaptation task involving both augmented and shortened
saccades. The controls, and patients with an intact oculomotor vermis
adapted to the augmentation by increasing saccade durration, but not
peak velocity. They adapted to inward adaptation, or reduction, by both
parameters. In contrast, patients with damage to the oculomotor vermis
TODO: Find a place for this paper and provide a better summary.




Functional Basis of Saccadic Adaptation
-------------------------------------


* Organizing by Types of Evidence:

FIXME: Not sure how deep I should dive into cerebellum. I have avoided
describing substructures, even though the oculomotor vermis is probably
an important one. For a description, see @Thier2002 "The Role of the
Oculomotor Vermis..."

While behavioral, or psychophysical experimental designs have been the
primary source of information about the functional basis of saccadic
adaptation, Lesion studies, single cell stimulation and recording in
  animals, and neuroimaging studies provide evidence for a converging
view of the structures involved and their relative inputs.

* The superior colliculus is known to be critically involved in
generating goal-directed saccades [@Sparks1990; @Guitton1991].

* Some evidence that more than the superior colliculus / cerebellum
loop are available. Cortical frontal eye fields may be involved in
saccadic adaptation [@Frens1994; @Noto1999] TODO: more info about
studies. @Melis1996 used a target-jump paradigm to adaptively modify
electrically stimulated saccades (superior colliculus). After
adaptation, only a partial transfer to visually elicited saccades
-indicating that some portion of the system was not affected by the
electrically stimulated saccades. The authors postulate that both
direct projections from both the frontal eye fields and superior
colliculus to a brainstem saccadic generator. These parallel pathways
are combined to produce parametric adaptation, and adaptation of only a
single pathway would be expected to produce only partial adaptation of
natural saccades. This theory also indicates caution where
generalizations from monkey research are required. The weightings of
the two parallell pathways are not likely to be completely identical
between species, and with the enlarged cortical areas of the human
brain, it seems probable that the relative contributions of the cortex
may also have been changed [@Fuchs1996, @Frens1994]. This is supported
by differential findings in behavioral studies where adaptation
transfer occurs in monkeys but not humans from reactive to volitional
saccades [@Erkelens1993; @Deubel1995], eye movements to head movements
[@Kroller1996 in humans compared with @Phillips1997 and @Fuchs1996 in
monkeys]. The time course of adaptation is also much shorter in humans
[@Deubel1986; Frens1994] relative to monkeys [@Fuchs1996; Straube1997;
Scudder1998]. As with any field of research, it's debatable how much of
the monkey-human differences are due to unique neural functionaltiy,
and how much is due simply to experimental design differences required
by the different capabilities of the subjects.



### Lesions

The preponderance of lesion studies involve cerebellar lesions[big
list], implicating the cerebellum as a necissary component in the
saccadic adaptation system[]. Importantly, though, many other areas
seem to be important for maintaining saccadic accuracy over time[], and
seem to be key factors in maintaining certain parameters, like X[], or
Y[].

Saccadic adaptation is actually one of a set of adaptation
methodologies that has been central to understanding the cerebellum.
People with damage to the cerebellum are typically cheracterized as
having loss of movement coordination, or "ataxia" of one movement type
or another. A more nuanced view, though reveals two very basic
deficits. First, movement precision is poor, with delayed and
inappropriate corrections producing oscillations, or "intention
tremors", especially for multi-joint complex actions []. Secondly, and
more directly relevant to the discussion of saccadic adaptation, they
typically fail to respond to feedback like that of saccadic adaptation.

The intention tremors seem to be related to an ineffective or delayed
use of sensory feedback, as it is reduced or absent when patients point
to targets with their eyes closed [@Day1998].

Further, cerebellar damage seems to cause a variety of oculomotor
deficits, including dysmetria of saccadic eye movements, and Nystagmus,
an involentary eye movement consisting of slow drift and fast resetting
phases, as well as an abnormal vestible-occular reflex
[@Diedrichsen2013].

People with syndromes associated with serebellar dysfunction also show
impaired saccadic adaptation [@Waespe1992].

In monkeys, targeted damage to the cerebellum (Oculomotor cerebellar
vermis, fastigial nuclei) can nearly eliminate the ability to adapt
saccades [@Optican1980; @Goldberg1993; @Takagi1998; @Barash1999]



The cerebellum hints at a temptingly universal function, ocassionally
affectionately reffered to as the cerrebellar transform. It's recursive
connectivity with motor, sensory and other areas of the cortex as well
as brainstem and direct spinal pathways, as well as it's
universal-seeming motor-refining abilities, and uniform but modulear
histological structure, hint at a general function applied to a wide
range of motor actions. Unfortunately, the exact nature of this
"cerrebellar transform" is a longstanding problem in neuroscience, and
goes far beyond what can be discussed here. In brief, it may serve as a
"predictive forward model" builder for motor control [@Maill1998], or
provide the input to build such models if they happen to be located
elsewhere in the cortex. Alternatively, the more classical description
of cerrebellar function is that of error-based learning
[@Marr1969; @Albus] origionally described a computational model of error-based
learning in the cerebellar cortex, and that idea of error-based
learning has been adopted as a central notion in research into the
cerebellum to date.  Unfortunately. the Marr/Albus theories, while
recognizing the apparent need for an "error-signal" to drive neuromotor
learning, but they provide only a rudimentary idea of the type and
function of that error [see @Highstein2005 for a modern discussion]. The
contemporary idea of error-based learning is based on the comparison of
predicted and actual sensory movement outcomes. Crucually, it is the
signed difference between those outcomes that is capable of providing
the impetus for a lasting parametric adaptation [@Tseng2007].

Cerebellar lesions can effectively eliminate prism adaptation, both in
terms of corrections to movements while wearing prisms, and any
aftereffects [@Martin1996]. Simmilar results have been found with
adapting pointing movements to a force field or purturbations produced
by a robot arm [@Maschke2004; @Smith2005], gait adaptation to a
split-belt treadmill [@Morton2006], and reaching under novel visuomotor
transformations [@Tseng2007]. Saccadic adaptation is thus one of many
sensorimotor adaptations that seem to require the cerebellum
[@Golla2008, @Prsa2011]. However, some resarchers have found hypometria
but unimpaired saccadic adaptation in patients with diffuse cerebellar
atrophy and cerebellar infarction [@Choi2008].

<! OCV/cerebellum, fatigue, inward/outward differences>



#### Cerebellum

The cerebellum is a key area for movement control and sensory-motor
plasticity. A full analysis of what is known about the neural
substrates of saccadic adaptation in the cerebellum would be beyond the
scope of this dissertation. However, the vast majority of neuroscience
research investigating saccadic adaptation has investigeted, and
in-fact implicated, structures in the cerebellum as being either
involved-in or directly responsible for the learning the new oculomotor
parameters. As a result, this a dedicated section is necissary here to
provide an overview of the state the current models of cerebellar
involement. For more extensive reviews, see @Iwamoto2010 and @Pelisson2010.

Medial, posterior, cerebellum (vermis and fastigial nuclei) is thot to
be central in the control of accuracy and adaptive calibration of
saccadic eye movements [for reviews see: @Hopp2004!, @Pelisson2003!, @Pelisson2010!].
For example, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the
medioposterior cerebellum has been shown to produce an inhibitory effect
on saccadic adaptation [@Jenkinson2010!]. Evidence for the role of other
areas of the cerebellum is much more spurratic and and difficult to
glean a clear-cut role from. Deficits of saccadic adaptation observed in
humans with cerebellar lesions suggest possible importance of lateral structures
[@Alahyane2008!, @Choi2008!, @Golla2008!, Straube2001!]. Some electophysiological
studies [@Mano1991, @Ron1973] and imaging studies
[@Dieterich2000!, @Hayakawa2002!, @Schraa-Tam2009!] have hinted at other parts
of the cerrebellum being involved in the control of saccades TODO: expand above.

In order to investigate the involvement of lateral cerebellum,
@Panouill√®res2012 found that TMS over the human left Crus I of the
cerebellum after saccade detection had a dual effect on saccadic
placticity. Perhapse paradoxically, after-effects indicated that it
both reduced the effectiveness of saccade-shortening adaptation (for
saccades moving contralateral to the stimulation), and augmented
saccade-lengthening adaptation (for saccades in both directions)
[@Panouill√®res2012]. In addition to afirming lateral cerrebelum in
saccadic adaptation, this provides further evidence for unique neural
methanisms of saccadic depression and potentiation, and hints at an
antagonistic relationship between the two. Interestingly, the authors
also found that TMS immediately at saccade-onset, rather than after a delay,
induced hypometria in that same saccade, to a small degree, but
consistantly in both directions. However, saccades with 30 or 60ms delayed TMS were
not measurably effected, and all three conditions lead to the after-effects
described above. TODO: reorder paragraph above?




* The population response of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum seems
to encode or influence the duration of normal and gain-increased
saccades, but not gain-decreased saccades[@Catz2008].

* tDCS suggests cerebellum may produce short-term modifications of
forward models, with the neocortex storing longer-lasting memories
[@Galea2011!]


### Electrical Stimulation/recording
Because saccadic adaptation is an important low-level function of
mammilian visual systems -which all have imperfect ability to produce
accurate muscular torque over time, and imperfect perceptual abilities,
it's not unreasonable to utilize animal experiments to better
understand the mechanisms. Single cell recordings, as well as direct
neural stimulation are invasive methodologies that, while not usually
possible with humans, can be done with animals to directly test causal
contributors to systems like those involved in saccadic adaptation.

* Electrical stimulation in monkey SC [@Melis1996]

* Monkey SC activity [@Frens1997]

* Early research involving stimulation of the DLSC of the superior
colliculus of monkeys produced consistant amplitude saccades regardless
of saccadic adaptation [@Fitzgibbon1986; @Melis1996], indicating the
adapted parameter is not being added after the superior colliculus
stage of saccade generation. However, @Edelman2002 found that they
could, indeed, modify electrically evoked movements with saccadic
adaptation if the electrical stimuli were very low current (near
threshold), and when the velocity of electrically evoked saccades was
simmilar to the visually guided saccades in the adaptation.
TODO: this part needs to be updated re @Edelman above: Cell recordings off
collicular motor cells also show a remarkable consistancy in the face
of behavioral saccadic adaptation [@Goldberg1993; @Frens1997]. This
result would indicate the parametric adaptation is being added after
the colliculus. This aparent contradiction has resulted in heated
debate in the literature without a satisfactory resolution
[@Fitzgibbon1986; @Melis1996].

* Cerebellum is also known to play a part in generation of goal-directed
saccades [@Noda1991; Lewis1993]. (From Desmurget2000).



### Imaging

* @Desmurget2000 conducted a PET study with participants participating
in three conditions of adaptation of reactive saccades. The conditions
involved targets being purturbed intra-saccade systematically
(adaptation condition), randomly, or not at all (static). They examined
three potential loci for the effects of saccadic adaptation (a contrast
of the adaptation condition and the random condition), the frontal-eye
fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor vermis area of the
cerebellum. They found evidence that the cerebellum structure was
activated differentially durring adaptation, but neither of the other
two structures. Interestingly, when comparing the static and random
conditions, they also found behavioral evidence of single-trial effects
on saccade metrics, so it's possible that adaptive mechanisms were
equally engaged in the random condition as with the adaptive condition.
The frontal eye fields still did not become active when comparing
adaptation with the static condition, however, and this is consistant
with what other researchers have postulated, that frontal eye fields
are more specialized for voluntary, self-generated saccades rather than
the reactive saccades used in this experiment [@Deubel1995 pp3538]. The
authors also did not find superior colliculus activity in either
contrast, but are more cautious in interpreting this null result,
because of the lack of PET sensitivity in the deep structure, and a
conflicting result by @Paus1995. Perhapse the most intreguing finding, the
single-trial effects, display an insurmountable problem in the literature.
No-purturbation controls are insufficient because they, in addition to lacking
adaptation, also lack the corrective saccades and provide a generally much more
predictible environment for the participant, while random-purturbation controls
seem to actually be impacting adaptive systems -albeit in a way that, over the long term,
produces no systematic changes. As a result, neither control is very effective.

TODO: Take a look if @Desmurget or Pellison updated since then.


* Bilateral Frontal-eye field activation during oculomotor tasks [@Paus1993]


### Behavioural
Examining the particularities of saccadic adaptation and the neural
functionality of it are deeply intertwined. Most of the behavioral and
psychopysisical evidence discussed in earlier sections here provide
clues about where in the perception and action systems the adaptation
may be occuring. More specifically, though, we are able to glean an
estimate of the earliest stages of vision, and the latest stages of
perception and action systems that are involved in saccadic adaptation,
providing a rough outline of the functional anatomy.


* Separate neural substrates for reactive vs. voluntary saccades
* Express vs. targeting saccades indicate earliest stage [@Hopp2002]

### Learning models comparison

* @Fujita2005 developed a model of feed-forward associative motor
learning which works by associating the primary motor command with the
corrective motor command directly. The implication is that the motor
center and learning device share the same place-encoded information,
the motor center issues a learnign signal and motor command as one
signal, from the same unit, and the learning signal issued with a
corrective command has a heterosynaptic interaction with the previous
primary command. TODO: Find out how much traction this theory has in
the literature. If it's significant, clarify and integrate with the
other models.


### Conclusions
* (need to bring above lines of evidence to some sort of convergence)
* Cerebellum
* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp2002]




Transient Saccadic Perceptual Effects
-----------------------------------

Saccades are a motor action that has the potential for the strongest
influence on perception. Eye movements are continually responsible for
the content of what is fed to the perceptual streams, as they direct
our gaze and dictate where and when we aquire the visual information
which provides the pieces with which we construct our internal
representation of the visual world.

Further, saccades have the ability to mask large changes in the visual
scene through saccadic supression, indicating a perceptual system that
is forever subserviant, or dependant on action systems. Eyemovemnts are
strongly coupled to goal-direction actions Neggers2001GazeAnchoring.

* Brief overview of the established pre/post saccade influences
  on perception. Purpose is to demonstrate SA and perception are
  related, as well as seaway to the next section.




Lasting Perceptual Effects & Implications for Clinical Populations
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Posterior focal lesions in the cerebellum can lead to perceptual
learning deficits, as aposed to motor-learning deficits found in anterior
cerebellar lesions [@Deluca2014]. This result indicates that perceputal
learning may involve mechanisms much more closely related to motor learning,
like saccadic adaptation, than previously though.

### Results hinting at enduring effects of SA

* 2 basic types of enduring effects. Attention and motor transfer.


### Examples of Clinical Application

* Briefly mention the use of SA in hemianopic patients [@Lvy2012] and
  abnormal eye movements during reading [@Desestret2013]

### Potential future research directions

* wide area adaptation [@Garaas2008]

* Concluding section should include possible experimental directions
  **and** drive the point home that this could be an untapped source of
  information about spatial cognition and potential clinical
  application.

* Possible controversial claim: The academic distance between
  psycho-physics (where SA has been developed) and clinical
  neuropsychology may be responsible for a research blind spot here.
  This may be a good example of the need for more interdisciplinary
  collaboration.


#### Notes to self:

* Wording:
  Potentiation vs. depression of adaptation.
  Gain increase or decrease, lengthening or shortening, inward or outward (from fovia).
  Also, after-effects can be described as hypometria and hypermetria.
