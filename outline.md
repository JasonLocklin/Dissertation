Saccadic Adaptation and Spatial Perception
========================================

<!-- Saccades are -->

Saccades are precise motor movements that are usually programmed to
move the eyes to foviate a specific target. Saccadic supression, and the
speed limitations of retinal cells, prevent visual information from
reaching the brain during the movement [@Matin1982], and thus the brain
from making on-line motor corrections, and yet, the eyes land reliably
close to the target most of the time. This ability to execute a
pre-programmed motor movement with extreme precision, reliably, and
maintain that ability over a lifetime, despite operating, essentially
"blind," is a testement to one or more highly capable underlying
control systems.

<!-- Saccadic accuracy is maintained through adaptation -->

Any motor system must incorporate a realistic expectation of
inaccuracy, and perform in way that minimises consequences. Because
on-line feedback is not available in this particular case, the visual
motor system is forced to rely on information gleaned after-the-fact,
or, in other words, "error signals," to maintain effective control
mechanism parameters[]. There exists a rich, half-century of
investigation into this short-term parametric adaptation of saccades,
or simply "saccadic adaptation," based on the origional paradigm
developed by [@mclaughlin1967]. Saccaddic adaptation tasks mimick and
amplify oculomotor processes that occur naturally and on a continual
basis in humans. For example, neuromuscular changes, such as a paresis
of ocular muscles, or the wearing of magnifying glasses, result in some
saccadic error, and the neuroplasticity underlying saccadic adaptation
permit correction so that vision is not impaired. These types of
purturbations can be monocular or binocular [@Erkelens1989] and can
effect saccadic accuracy in various dimensions[].

<!-- SA is motoric, but also perception -compare with prisms -->

From the earliest discussion, saccadic adaptation has been compared to
prism adaptation and other examples of sensory-motor neural plasticity
[@mclaughlin1967]. Two characteristics make it unique. First, as
mentioned above, unlike other adaptive systems, saccadic adaptation is
unable to rely on feedback, due to the saccadic supression. Second, it
straddles the perceptual and motor systems in a highly unique way.
Saccadic adaptation *is* a form of sensory adaptation, because it
changes the way the environment is percieved. Vision is entirely
dependent on where the eyes look, so when eye movements change, the
input to the visual systems are directly changes. At the same time
saccadic adaptation *is* motor adaptation, as it is fundamentally the
parameters of motor movements, not sensitivity, that is adapted. Prisms
are simmilar, but involve different systems. While SA effects the motor
plan to execute a saccade to a particular point in a person's visual
periphery, Prisms don't change eye movements. Instead, they shift the
ocular position of "straight ahead" in body-centric terms.


<!-- SA involves a complicated set of mechanisms -->

It would be easy to assume that saccadic adaptation occurs by the
integration of a relatively simple "error signal" into a type of
universal saccadic "gain" parameter. Ultimately, this does not appear
to be the case. There is, in fact, more than one type of error signal
that the brain could make use of, from both motor afferent signals and
the visual system, as well as several possible parametric ways of
changing saccade amplitude []. This complex set of features make
saccadic adaptation an interesting way to investigate functional
plasticity mechanisms in the brain, and provides a clear contrast with
prisms, for which the updating mechanisms are not functionally
equivelant. This comparable, but functionally different response to
saccadic relative to prism adaptation may provide a profitable avenue
for investigating, or even ameliorating the assymetrical attention
problems in people with Unilateral Neglect or other related disorders.



Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------

### Volitional and Reactive Saccades 

Saccades, generally, can be subdivided into two types based on
function. Humans and most other visual animals respond to sudden
changes in peripheral space by orienting, and typically foviating the
stimuli. This is necessisary in humans because of impoverished retinal
resolution and perceptual information processing in the visual
periphery. The need to quickly assess environmental changes provides a
universal drive to orients accuratly and quickly toward such stimuli,
with little top-down interference.

In contrast, self-directed investigation of an environment by
goal-directed, internally initiated saccades, such as in visual search,
requires a somewhat different strategy. Such saccades are, by
definition, going to involve a greater degree of entanglement with
conscious goal-monitoring mechanisms, and other high-level cognitive
systems. As such, unlike reactive saccades, these voluntary saccades
are very likely to involve move extensive functional brain areas, and
exhibit somewhat different characteristics. Besides different functional
brain structures, volitional and reactive saccades, also called targetting
and express saccades, respectively in the literature, present different 
behavioral characteristics. For example, reactive saccades exhibit
very short latencies when compared with volitional saccades [tk]. 


#### Distinct Systems.

Saccades triggered by exogenous cues, like a sudden movement or
appearance of an object in the periphery are considered reactive
saccades and are typically contrasted with voluntary saccades.
Voluntary saccades are the type of normal eye movements performed
based on the execution and monitoring of internal goals like
searching for an object or monitoring the progress of a manual task.
While this destinction doesn't appear to bear out in the cerebellum,
it does seem to explain a degree of functional specialization in the
oculomotor areas of the cerebral cortex [@Schraa-Tam2009,@Müri2008].
As a result, it's valuable to keep in mind the destinction when
comparing results from experiments which may be utilizing different
saccade types, and when atempting to extrapolate mechanistic models
based on simple reactive saccades to more naturalistic behaviour.

Cerebellum is also known to play a part in generation of goal-directed
saccades [@Noda1991!; @Lewis1993!]. (From Desmurget2000).

The superior colliculus is known to be critically involved in
generating goal-directed saccades [@Sparks1990; @Guitton1991].


#### Distinct Characteristics

Papers examining the differing mechanisms (but not neural substrates)
between reactive and voluntary saccades [@Alahyane2007, @Collins2006,
@Cotti2007, @Cotti2009, @Deubel1995, @Erkelens1993, @Fujita2002,
@Zimmermann2009].


An appreciation for the behavioral and functional differences between
voluntary and reactive saccades should inform any discussion of
saccadic adaptation. Most research into saccadic adaptation involves
the adaptation of reactive saccades, and there is a danger of
overgeneralizing results from this work to all eye movements.
Results from the adaptation of volitional saccades, or better yet, from
research involving both types of saccades, are always going to give a
more reliable picture of the mechanics of maintaining the effectiveness
of voluntary eye movements.


### Adaptation

* Structure

While variants of the standard target-purturbation based paradigm are
the base of research investigating saccadic adaptation, much of the
information about the structural functionality maintaining saccadic
accuracy come from the effects of lesions or other neural dysfunction,
and animal research. 

Because saccadic adaptation is an important
low-level function of mammilian visual systems -which all have
imperfect ability to produce accurate muscular torque over time, and
imperfect perceptual abilities, it's not unreasonable to utilize animal
experiments to better understand the mechanisms. 

Two approaches to study sacccadic adapation in animals have typically
been used. The more common procedure of purturbing targets durring the
perceptual blindness of a saccade, and lesioning extraocular muscles in
monkeys [@Optican1980; @Scudder1998].

@Desmurget2000 conducted a PET study with participants participating in
three conditions of adaptation of reactive saccades. The conditions
involved targets being purturbed intra-saccade systematically
(adaptation condition), randomly, or not at all (static). They examined
three potential loci for the effects of saccadic adaptation (a contrast
of the adaptation condition and the random condition), the frontal-eye
fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor vermis area of the
cerebellum. They found evidence that the cerebellum structure was
activated differentially durring adaptation, but neither of the other
two structures. Interestingly, when comparing the static and random
conditions, they also found behavioral evidence of single-trial effects
on saccade metrics, so it's possible that adaptive mechanisms were
equally engaged in the random condition as with the adaptive condition.
The frontal eye fields still did not become active when comparing
adaptation with the static condition, however, and this is consistant
with what other researchers have postulated, that frontal eye fields
are more specialized for voluntary, self-generated saccades rather than
the reactive saccades used in this experiment [@Deubel1995 pp3538]. The
authors also did not find superior colliculus activity in either
contrast, but are more cautious in interpreting this null result,
because of the lack of PET sensitivity in the deep structure, and a
conflicting result by @Paus1995. Perhapse the most intreguing finding,
the single-trial effects, display an insurmountable problem in the
literature. No-purturbation controls are insufficient because they, in
addition to lacking adaptation, also lack the corrective saccades and
provide a generally much more predictible environment for the
participant, while random-purturbation controls seem to actually be
impacting adaptive systems -albeit in a way that, over the long term,
produces no systematic changes. As a result, neither control is very
effective.

TODO: Take a look if @Desmurget or Pellison updated since then.


##### Cerebellum

[Cerebellum=control] Saccadic adaptation is actually one of a set of
adaptation methodologies that has been central to understanding the
cerebellum. The cerebellum is a key area for movement control and
sensory-motor plasticity [@Glickstein2011]. A full analysis of what is
known about the neural substrates of saccadic adaptation in the
cerebellum would be beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, the
vast majority of neuroscience research investigating saccadic
adaptation has investigeted, and in-fact implicated, structures in the
cerebellum as being either involved-in or directly responsible for the
learning the new oculomotor parameters.  For more extensive reviews,
see @Iwamoto2010 and @Pelisson2010.

[damage leads to loss of control] People with damage to the cerebellum
are typically cheracterized as having loss of movement coordination, or
"ataxia" of one movement type or another. A more nuanced view, though
reveals two very basic deficits. First, movement precision is poor,
with delayed and inappropriate corrections producing oscillations, or
"intention tremors", especially for multi-joint complex actions [].
Secondly, and more directly relevant to the discussion of saccadic
adaptation, they typically fail to respond to feedback like that of
saccadic adaptation. The intention tremors seem to be related to an
ineffective or delayed use of sensory feedback, as it is reduced or
absent when patients point to targets with their eyes closed
[@Day1998].

[including SA] Further, cerebellar damage seems to cause
a variety of oculomotor deficits, including dysmetria of saccadic eye
movements, and Nystagmus, an involentary eye movement consisting of
slow drift and fast resetting phases, as well as an abnormal
vestible-occular reflex [@Diedrichsen2013]. People with syndromes
associated with serebellar dysfunction also show impaired saccadic
adaptation [@Waespe1992]. Similarily, in monkeys, targeted damage to
the cerebellum (Oculomotor cerebellar vermis, fastigial nuclei) can
nearly eliminate the ability to adapt saccades [@Optican1980;
@Goldberg1993; @Takagi1998; @Barash1999]

[Certain areas in particular] Medial, posterior, cerebellum (vermis
and fastigial nuclei) is thought to be central in the control of
accuracy and adaptive calibration of saccadic eye movements [for
reviews see: @Hopp2004, @Pélisson2003, @Pélisson2010]. For example,
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the medioposterior
cerebellum has been shown to produce an inhibitory effect on saccadic
adaptation [@Jenkinson2010]. Evidence for the role of other areas of
the cerebellum is much more sporadic and and difficult to glean a
clear-cut role from. Deficits of saccadic adaptation observed in humans
with cerebellar lesions suggest possible importance of lateral
structures [@Alahyane2008, @Choi2008, @Golla2008, Straube2001]. Some
electophysiological studies [@Mano1991, @Ron1973] and imaging studies
[@Dieterich2000!, @Hayakawa2002!, @Schraa-Tam2009] have hinted at other
parts of the cerrebellum being involved in the control of saccades


[The Cerebellum is doing...] The cerebellum hints at a temptingly
universal function, ocassionally affectionately reffered to as the
cerrebellar transform. It's recursive connectivity with motor, sensory
and other areas of the cortex as well as brainstem and direct spinal
pathways, as well as it's universal-seeming motor-refining abilities,
and uniform but modulear histological structure, hint at a general
function applied to a wide range of motor actions. Unfortunately, the
exact nature of this "cerrebellar transform" is a longstanding problem
in neuroscience, and goes far beyond what can be discussed here. In
brief, it may serve as a "predictive forward model" builder for motor
control [@Maill1998], or provide the input to build such models if they
happen to be located elsewhere in the cortex. Alternatively, the more
classical description of cerrebellar function is that of error-based
learning [@Marr1969; @Albus] origionally described a computational
model of error-based learning in the cerebellar cortex, and that idea
of error-based learning has been adopted as a central notion in
research into the cerebellum to date.  Unfortunately, the Marr/Albus
theories, while recognizing the apparent need for an "error-signal" to
drive neuromotor learning, provide only a rudimentary idea of the type
and function of that error [see @Highstein2005 for a modern
discussion]. The contemporary idea of error-based learning is based on
the comparison of predicted and actual sensory movement outcomes.
Crucually, it is the signed difference between those outcomes that is
capable of providing the impetus for a lasting parametric adaptation
[@Tseng2007]. TODO: edit above paragraph.

[Not so simple] Cerebellar lesions can also effectively eliminate prism
adaptation, both in terms of corrections to movements while wearing
prisms, and any aftereffects [@Martin1996]. Simmilar results have been
found with adapting pointing movements to a force field or
purturbations produced by a robot arm [@Maschke2004; @Smith2005], gait
adaptation to a split-belt treadmill [@Morton2006], and reaching under
novel visuomotor transformations [@Tseng2007]. Saccadic adaptation is
thus one of many sensorimotor adaptations that seem to require the
cerebellum [@Golla2008, @Prsa2011]. However, even this finding may be
influenced by other oculomotor deficits. For example, some resarchers
have found hypometria but unimpaired saccadic adaptation in patients
with diffuse cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar infarction [@Choi2008].
The picture is likely far more complex than the cerebelluum, and almost
certainly involves a complex interplay with other structures, like the
superior colliculus and cortical areas.



##### Colliculus

The reciprocal connectivity between the cerebellum and the colliculus
implicated the loop in saccadic adaptation early on. 

* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp2002]

* Electrical stimulation in monkey SC [@Melis1996]

* Monkey SC activity [@Frens1997]

* Early research involving stimulation of the DLSC of the superior
colliculus of monkeys produced consistant amplitude saccades regardless
of saccadic adaptation [@Fitzgibbon1986; @Melis1996], indicating the
adapted parameter is not being added after the superior colliculus
stage of saccade generation. However, @Edelman2002 found that they
could, indeed, modify electrically evoked movements with saccadic
adaptation if the electrical stimuli were very low current (near
threshold), and when the velocity of electrically evoked saccades was
simmilar to the visually guided saccades in the adaptation.
TODO: this part needs to be updated re @Edelman2002 above: Cell recordings off
collicular motor cells also show a remarkable consistancy in the face
of behavioral saccadic adaptation [@Goldberg1993; @Frens1997]. This
result would indicate the parametric adaptation is being added after
the colliculus. This aparent contradiction has resulted in heated
debate in the literature without a satisfactory resolution
[@Fitzgibbon1986; @Melis1996].

##### Cortical structures

Some evidence that more than the superior colliculus / cerebellum
loop are available. Cortical frontal eye fields may be involved in
saccadic adaptation [@Frens1994; @Noto1999] TODO: more info about
studies. @Melis1996 used a target-jump paradigm to adaptively modify
electrically stimulated saccades (superior colliculus). After
adaptation, only a partial transfer to visually elicited saccades
-indicating that some portion of the system was not affected by the
electrically stimulated saccades. The authors postulate that both
direct projections from both the frontal eye fields and superior
colliculus to a brainstem saccadic generator. These parallel pathways
are combined to produce parametric adaptation, and adaptation of only a
single pathway would be expected to produce only partial adaptation of
natural saccades. This theory also indicates caution where
generalizations from monkey research are required. The weightings of
the two parallell pathways are not likely to be completely identical
between species, and with the enlarged cortical areas of the human
brain, it seems probable that the relative contributions of the cortex
may also have been changed [@Fuchs1996, @Frens1994]. This is supported
by differential findings in behavioral studies where adaptation
transfer occurs in monkeys but not humans from reactive to volitional
saccades [@Erkelens1993; @Deubel1995], eye movements to head movements
[@Kroller1996 in humans compared with @Phillips1997 and @Fuchs1996 in
monkeys]. The time course of adaptation is also much shorter in humans
[@Deubel1986; Frens1994] relative to monkeys [@Fuchs1996; Straube1997;
Scudder1998]. As with any field of research, it's debatable how much of
the monkey-human differences are due to unique neural functionaltiy,
and how much is due simply to experimental design differences required
by the different capabilities of the subjects.


* Bilateral Frontal-eye field activation during oculomotor tasks [@Paus1993]
* Cortical areas showing differential activation in humans [@Schraa-Tam2009].
* @Müri2008 provides a review of leason and TMS studies investigating cortical
dependants of volitional and reactive saccades.
* Cortical areas showing differential activation in primates [@Johnston2008].
* Cerebellar lesions may affect reactive saccades, but not
self-generated saccades [@Straube1995].
* Seperate neural substrates in the human cerebellum for adaptation of
reactive and voluntary saccades [@Alahyane2008].
* @Panouillères2013 examined the cerebellar substrates of adaptive
shortening by looking for dissasociations between reactive and volitional
saccades among patients with damage to, or impaired input to (because of
Wallenberg Syndrome), regions of the cerebellum. In a study of patients
with cerebellar lesions, @Panouillères2013 found that while damage to
the medio-posterior cerebellum does not differentially impair either
reactive or volitional saccades, damage to supero-anterior regions showed
specific deficits in the adaptation of voluntary saccades.



#### Adaptation of saccades is not generalized

Some of the most reliable characteristics found when investigating
saccadic adaptation are position and direction specificity. When
saccades are adapted to targets restricted to a particular location in
retinal (2D) space, the effects do not transfer to saccades made to
distant locations [@Miller1981; @Frens1994; Noto1999; @Alahyane2004;
@Alahyane2003]. Interestingly, the same lack of transfer can be found
from one point to another in 3D peripersonal space [@Chaturvedi1997].
Others have found that when addapted in one meridian, there is little
transfer to others [Lemij1992]. There also seems to be strict
independence of horizontal and vertical adaptation [@Watanabe2003].
Adaptation of a particular saccade amplitude do not generalize to other
amplitudes [@Miller1981; @Frens1994; @Albano1996; @Straube1997]. And,
perhapse the most reliable and long-observed specificity is
directional. When, for example, leftward saccades are augmented or
reduced with saccadic adaptation, rightward saccades are uneffected,
regardless of the spatial position overlap [@Deubel1986; @Frens1994;
@Albano1996].


#### Reference frame independance

The different dimensions of adaptation described above can be
re-phrased in terms of spatial reference frames. Particular locations
in retinal space could be considered orbitocentric or retinocentric,
depending on whether starting postion matters, while directional
effects, or differences between saccade reduction and augmentation can
be thought of as oculocentric.

[@albano1996] had participants observe targets as they were displaced
horizontally across a computer scree, and indicate whenever the target
dimmed. The final position of one trial became the starting position of
the next, so that to the participant, the target seemingly moved
randomly back and forth across the screen. Intrasaccadic target
displacements were made in order to induce saccadic adaptation. They
were always horizontal, and when they occured, always a 40 percent
change, either more or less than the initial saccadic distance at the
beginning of the trial. The resulting data

* Spacial reference frames [@Albano1996]

All of these demensions on which saccadic adaptation can apply indicate
a complex, multi-level sysetem involving various neurals structures.

#### Augmentation and reduction are probably uniquely specialized.

There are a variety of reasons for oculomotor systems to become more 
error-prone. One natural cause, however, is both likely to be both
ever-present and unidirectional in the error it produces. Muscular fatigue
is presumably a major contributor to an organism's need for adaptive
mechanisms, and unlike, for example, damage to a particular muscle, or 
other biomechanical changes, fatigue is always going to reduce saccadic 
amplitude, regardless of the direction of the saccade. It stands to reason
that the "fatigue coping" system, because it is going to be continually 
engaged, may be different in some ways than the mechanisms for lengthening,
or augmenting, saccades over time. 


Naturally, neuromuscular fatigue only results in shortening of saccades, so may be unique.

* Behavioral difference between shortenning and lengthening of saccades.

* Structural differences

The population response of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum seems
to encode or influence the duration of normal and gain-increased
saccades, but not gain-decreased saccades[@Catz2008].

Inward and Outward or lengthening and shortening adaptation, or
backward and forward adaptation may involve different mechanisms, and
have different purposes. (eg. fatigue). See @Catz2008, @Golla2008,
@Hernandez2008!, @Kojima2004!, @Panouillères2009!, @Panouillères2012,
@Zimmermann2009!,

@Golla2008 tested controls and patients with cerebellar damage on a
saccadic adaptation task involving both augmented and shortened
saccades. The controls, and patients with an intact oculomotor vermis
adapted to the augmentation by increasing saccade durration, but not
peak velocity. They adapted to inward adaptation, or reduction, by both
parameters. In contrast, patients with damage to the oculomotor vermis


##### Cerebellar Vermis and lateral structures

The cerebellar vermis, and more specifically, the vermal lobuli VI and
VII, commonly called the posterior, or oculomotor vermis, is probably
the best studied and well known contributor to the control of saccadic
eye movements. Purkinje cells in this area are sensitive to eye
position and, as a population, encode saccade parameters like saccade
timing and direction [@Thier2002]. 


Medio-posterior cerebellum (oculomotor vermis
and caudal part of the fastigial nucleus) contributes to
backward adaptation of reactive saccades [@HoppFuchs2004!,
@IwamotoKaku2010!, @Pelisson2010!; PrsaThier2011!; Tian2009!]. For
example, patients with lesions of the cerebellar vermis [@Golla2008],
or with a neurodegenerative desease which happens to primarily damage
the Purkinje cells of the vermis [@Xu-Wilson2009!] are unresponsive to
saccade shortening, reactive saccadic adaptation. TODO: Further evedence
provided by [@Desmurget1998, @Jenkin-sonMiall2010!].

It also requires mentioning that there is some evidence of
involvement of other parts of the cerebellum in the adaptation of
reactive saccades. @Panouillères2012 was able to modify reactive
saccade adaptation with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the
hemispheric lobule Crus I. Others have found further hints of
hemispheric involvement [@Alahyane2008, @Choi2008, @Straube2001, @Broekhoven2009].


In order to investigate the involvement of lateral cerebellum,
@Panouillères2012 found that TMS over the human left Crus I of the
cerebellum after saccade detection had a dual effect on saccadic
placticity. Perhapse paradoxically, after-effects indicated that it
both reduced the effectiveness of saccade-shortening adaptation (for
saccades moving contralateral to the stimulation), and augmented
saccade-lengthening adaptation (for saccades in both directions)
[@Panouillères2012]. In addition to afirming lateral cerrebelum in
saccadic adaptation, this provides further evidence for unique neural
methanisms of saccadic depression and potentiation, and hints at an
antagonistic relationship between the two. Interestingly, the authors
also found that TMS immediately at saccade-onset, rather than after a delay,
induced hypometria in that same saccade, to a small degree, but
consistantly in both directions. However, saccades with 30 or 60ms delayed TMS were
not measurably effected, and all three conditions lead to the after-effects
described above. TODO: reorder paragraph above?




TODO: neural substrates of reactive saccadde *lengthening*?

Much less work has been done examining the neural substrates of the
adaptation of volitional saccades. @Alahyane2008 examined deficits
in both reactive and voluntary adapataion after lesions in both the medial
and lateral parts of the cerebellum TODO: expand. @Gerardin2012 used
neuroimaging to investigate both the cortical and cerebellar correlates
of the two types of saccades. Interestingly, hemispheric lobules
VIIb–VIIIa of the cerebellum were found to be activated during both types
of saccades.

* Medial/lateral is to reactive/scanning in two lesion patients [@Alahyane2008]
* Inward/Outward adaptation and fatigue (14 patients)[@Golla2008].


* Again, results from one type cannot be generalized.






### Functional model of adaptation

Examining the particularities of saccadic adaptation and the neural
functionality of it are deeply intertwined. Most of the behavioral and
psychopysisical evidence discussed in earlier sections here provide
clues about where in the perception and action systems the adaptation
may be occuring. More specifically, though, we are able to glean an
estimate of the earliest stages of vision, and the latest stages of
perception and action systems that are involved in saccadic adaptation,
providing a rough outline of the functional anatomy.


@Hopp2002 behaviorally adapted participants to either voluntary or
reactive saccades and found that to the extent that participants
retained the adaptation to the trained type, it transfered equally to
the other. This provides evidence supporting the notion that, despite
the two types of saccades involving different functional systems,
adaptation is probably happening at a shared point, like the superior
colliculus or cerebellum, rather than, for example, a cortical area.
This result was supported in a more recent replication that found
transfer between the two types of adapted saccades, but no mutual
transfer to or from adapted memory-guided saccades (saccades to
remembered target locations; @Hopp2010).

* @Fujita2005 developed a model of feed-forward associative motor
learning which works by associating the primary motor command with the
corrective motor command directly. The implication is that the motor
center and learning device share the same place-encoded information,
the motor center issues a learnign signal and motor command as one
signal, from the same unit, and the learning signal issued with a
corrective command has a heterosynaptic interaction with the previous
primary command. TODO: Find out how much traction this theory has in
the literature. If it's significant, clarify and integrate with the
other models.

* tDCS suggests cerebellum may produce short-term modifications of
forward models, with the neocortex storing longer-lasting memories

Prediction based error signal [@Wong2012]
  


Transient Saccadic Perceptual Effects
-----------------------------------

Saccades are a motor action that has the potential for the strongest
influence on perception. Eye movements are continually responsible for
the content of what is fed to the perceptual streams, as they direct
our gaze and dictate where and when we aquire the visual information
which provides the pieces with which we construct our internal
representation of the visual world.

Further, saccades have the ability to mask large changes in the visual
scene through saccadic supression, indicating a perceptual system that
is forever subserviant, or dependant on action systems. Eyemovemnts are
strongly coupled to goal-direction actions Neggers2001GazeAnchoring.

* Brief overview of the established pre/post saccade influences
  on perception. Purpose is to demonstrate SA and perception are
  related, as well as seaway to the next section.

* Mislocalization [@Zimmermann2009].

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane2005]


Lasting Perceptual Effects & Implications for Clinical Populations
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Posterior focal lesions in the cerebellum can lead to perceptual
learning deficits, as aposed to motor-learning deficits found in anterior
cerebellar lesions [@Deluca2014]. This result indicates that perceputal
learning may involve mechanisms much more closely related to motor learning,
like saccadic adaptation, than previously though.

### Results hinting at enduring effects of SA

* 2 basic types of enduring effects. Attention and motor transfer.


### Examples of Clinical Application

* Briefly mention the use of SA in hemianopic patients [@Lvy2012] and
  abnormal eye movements during reading [@Desestret2013]

### Potential future research directions

* wide area adaptation [@Garaas2008]

* Concluding section should include possible experimental directions
  **and** drive the point home that this could be an untapped source of
  information about spatial cognition and potential clinical
  application.

* Possible controversial claim: The academic distance between
  psycho-physics (where SA has been developed) and clinical
  neuropsychology may be responsible for a research blind spot here.
  This may be a good example of the need for more interdisciplinary
  collaboration.
