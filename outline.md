* S.A. is 
* Prediction based error signal [@wong12]
* S.A. in the wild: Oculomotor weakness, anisometropic spectacles[@Erkelens89]


Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------

* reference frame [@Albano96]
* eye position specificity in 2D[@Alahyane04; @Alahyane03] and 3D [@Chaturvedi97] space, or along only one meridian [Lemij92], and ways around it [@Garaas08]
* independence of horizontal and vertical domains [@watanabe03]

* error signals influence dynamics (peak velocity) [@Straube95], and 
what does this tell us about saccadic regulation [@Ethier08]

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane05]


Functional Basis of Saccadic Adaptation
-------------------------------------

### Organizing by Types of Evidence:


#### Lesions
* Cerebellar lesions

#### Electrical Stimulation/recording
* Electrical stimulation in monkey SC [@Melis96]
* Monkey SC activity [@Frens97]

#### Behavioral
* Seperate neural substrates for reactive vs. voluntary saccades
* Express vs. targeting saccades indicate earliest stage [@Hopp02]

#### Imaging
* Neural corrleates

#### Conclusions
* Cerebellum
* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp02]
