Saccadic Adaptation and Spatial Perception
========================================

<!-- Saccades are -->
Saccades are precise motor movements that are usually programmed to move the
eyes to foviate a specific target. Saccadic supression and the speed limitations
of retinal cells prevent visual information from reaching the brain during the
movement, and thus the brain from making on-line motor corrections, and yet, the
eyes land reliably close to the target most of the time. This ability to execute
a pre-programmed motor movement with extreme precision, reliably, and maintain
that ability over a lifetime, despite operating, essentially "blind," is a
testement to one or more highly capable underlying control systems.

<!-- Saccadic accuracy is maintained through adaptation -->
Any motor system must incorporate a realistic expectation of inaccuracy, and
perform in way that minimises consequences. Because on-line feedback is not
available in this particular case, the visual motor system is forced to rely on
information gleaned after-the-fact, or, in other words, "error signals," to
maintain effective control mechanism parameters[]. There exists a rich,
half-century of investigation into this short-term parametric adaptation of
saccades, or simply "saccadic adaptation," based on the origional paradigm
developed by [@mclaughlin67]. Saccaddic adaptation tasks mimick and amplify
oculomotor processes that occur naturally and on a continual basis in humans.
For example, neuromuscular changes, such as a paresis of ocular muscles, or the
wearing of magnifying glasses, result in some saccadic error, and the mechanisms
underlying saccadic adaptation permit correction so that vision is not impaired.
These types of purturbations can be monocular or binocular [@Erkelens89] and can
effect saccadic accuracy in various dimensions[].

<!-- SA is motoric, but also perception -compare with prisms -->
From the earliest discussion, saccadic adaptation has been compared to prism
adaptation and other forms of sensory adaptation[@mclaughlin67]. Two
characteristics make it unique. First, as mentioned above, unlike other adaptive
systems, saccadic adaptation is unable to rely on feedback, due to the saccadic
supression. Second, it straddles the perceptual and motor systems in a highly
unique way. Saccadic adaptation *is* a form of sensory adaptation, because it
changes the way the environment is percieved. Vision is entirely dependent on
where the eyes look, so when eye movements change, the input to the visual
systems are directly changes. At the same time saccadic adaptation *is* motor
adaptation, as it is fundamentally the parameters of motor movements, not
sensitivity, that is adapted. Prisms are simmilar, but involve different systems.
While SA effects the motor plan to execute a saccade to a particular point in
a person's visual periphery, Prisms don't change eye movements. Instead, they
shift the ocular position of "straight ahead" in body-centric terms.


<!-- SA involves a complicated set of mechanisms -->
It would be easy to assume that saccadic adaptation occurs by the integration of
a relatively simple "error signal" into a type of universal saccadic "gain"
parameter. Ultimately, this does not appear to be the case. There is, in fact,
more than one type of error signal that the brain could make use of, from both
motor afferent signals and the visual system, as well as several possible
parametric ways of changing saccade amplitude []. This complex set of features
make saccadic adaptation an interesting way to investigate functional updating
mechanisms in the brain, and provides a clear contrast with prisms, for which
the updating mechanisms are not functionally equivelant. This comparable, but
functionally different response to saccadic relative to prism adaptation may
provide a profitable avenue for investigating, or even ameliorating the
assymetrical attention problems in people with Unilateral Neglect or other
related disorders.



Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------
Some of the most reliable characteristics found when investigating saccadic
adaptation are position and direction specificity. When saccades are adapted to
targets restricted to a particular location in retinal (2D) space, the effects
do not transfer to saccades made to distant locations [@Alahyane04;
@Alahyane03]. Interestingly, the same lack of transfer can be found from one
point to another in 3D peripersonal space [@Chaturvedi97]. Others have found
that when addapted in one meridian, there is little transfer to others
[Lemij92]. There also seems to be strict independence of horizontal and vertical
adaptation [@Watanabe03]. And, perhapse the most reliable and long-observed
specificity is directional. When, for example, leftward saccades are augmented
or reduced with saccadic adaptation, rightward saccades are uneffected,
regardless of the spatial position overlap [@Albano96; list of papers here...].

The different dimensions of adaptation described above can be re-phrased in
terms of spatial reference frames. Particular locations in retinal space could
be considered orbitocentric or retinocentric, depending on whether starting
postion matters, while directional effects, or differences between saccade
reduction and augmentation can be thought of as oculocentric.

[@albano96] had participants observe targets as they were displaced horizontally across
a computer scree, and indicate whenever the target dimmed. The final position of
one trial became the starting position of the next, so that to the participant, the target
seemingly moved randomly back and forth across the screen. Intrasaccadic target
displacements were made in order to induce saccadic adaptation. They were always
horizontal, and when they occured, always a 40 percent change, either more or less than
the initial saccadic distance at the beginning of the trial. The resulting data

* Spacial reference frames [@Albano96]




* error signals influence dynamics (peak velocity) [@Straube95], and
what does this tell us about saccadic regulation [@Ethier08]

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane05]
* Prediction based error signal [@wong12]

All of these demensions on which saccadic adaptation can apply indicate a complex,
multi-level sysetem involving various neurals structures.


Functional Basis of Saccadic Adaptation
-------------------------------------

* Organizing by Types of Evidence:

### Lesions
* Cerebellar lesions (this is a huge list, still need to narrow down
  to a few particularly useful papers)

* Other lesions?

### Electrical Stimulation/recording
* Electrical stimulation in monkey SC [@Melis96]
* Monkey SC activity [@Frens97]

### Behavioural
* Separate neural substrates for reactive vs. voluntary saccades
* Express vs. targeting saccades indicate earliest stage [@Hopp02]

### Imaging
* Neural correlates

### Conclusions
* (need to bring above lines of evidence to some sort of convergence)
* Cerebellum
* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp02]


Transient Saccadic Perceptual Effects
-----------------------------------
Saccades are a motor action that has the potential for the strongest
influence on perception. Eye movements are continually responsible for
the content of what is fed to the perceptual streams, as they direct
our gaze and dictate where and when we aquire the visual information which provides the pieces with which we construct our internal representation of the visual world.

Further, saccades have the ability to mask large changes in the visual scene
through saccadic supression, indicating a perceptual system that is
forever subserviant, or dependant on action systems. Eyemovemnts are
strongly coupled to goal-direction actions Neggers2001GazeAnchoring.

* Brief overview of the established pre/post saccade influences
  on perception. Purpose is to demonstrate SA and perception are
  related, as well as seaway to the next section.



Lasting Perceptual Effects & Implications for Clinical Populations
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Results hinting at enduring effects of SA

* 2 basic types of enduring effects. Attention and motor transfer.


### Examples of Clinical Application

* Briefly mention the use of SA in hemianopic patients [@Lvy2012] and
  abnormal eye movements during reading [@Desestret2013]

### Potential future research directions

* wide area adaptation [@Garaas08]

* Concluding section should include possible experimental directions
  **and** drive the point home that this could be an untapped source
  of information about spatial cognition and potential clinical
  application.

* Possible controversial claim: The academic distance between
  psycho-physics (where SA has been developed) and clinical
  neuropsychology may be responsible for a research blind spot here.
  This may be a good example of the need for more interdisciplinary
  collaboration.
