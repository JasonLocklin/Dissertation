Saccadic Adaptation and Spatial Perception
========================================

* S.A. is 
* Prediction based error signal [@wong12]
* S.A. in the wild: Oculomotor weakness, anisometropic
  spectacles[@Erkelens89]


Saccadic Adaptation Paradigm and Established Results
-------------------------------------------------

* Spacial reference frames [@Albano96]
* eye position specificity in 2D[@Alahyane04; @Alahyane03] and 3D
  [@Chaturvedi97] space, or along only one meridian [Lemij92], and ways
  around it [@Garaas08]
* independence of horizontal and vertical domains [@watanabe03]

* error signals influence dynamics (peak velocity) [@Straube95], and 
what does this tell us about saccadic regulation [@Ethier08]

* Importantly, are the effects transient or lasting? [@Alahyane05]


Functional Basis of Saccadic Adaptation
-------------------------------------

* Organizing by Types of Evidence:

### Lesions
* Cerebellar lesions (this is a huge list, still need to narrow down
  to a few particularly useful papers)

* Other lesions?

### Electrical Stimulation/recording
* Electrical stimulation in monkey SC [@Melis96]
* Monkey SC activity [@Frens97]

### Behavioural
* Separate neural substrates for reactive vs. voluntary saccades
* Express vs. targeting saccades indicate earliest stage [@Hopp02]

### Imaging
* Neural correlates

### Conclusions 
* (need to bring above lines of evidence to some sort of convergence)
* Cerebellum
* Superior Colliculus [@Hopp02]


Transient Saccadic Perceptual Effects
-----------------------------------

* Brief overview of the established pre/post saccade influences 
  on perception. Purpose is to demonstrate SA and perception are 
  related, as well as seaway to the next section.


Lasting Perceptual Effects & Implications for Clinical Populations
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Results hinting at enduring effects of SA

* 2 basic types of enduring effects. Attention and motor transfer. 


### Examples of Clinical Application

* Briefly mention the use of SA in hemianopic patients [@Lvy2012] and
  abnormal eye movements during reading [@Desestret2013]

### Potential future research directions

* Concluding section should include possible experimental directions 
  **and** drive the point home that this could be an untapped source
  of information about spatial cognition and potential clinical
  application.
  
* Possible controversial claim: The academic distance between
  psycho-physics (where SA has been developed) and clinical
  neuropsychology may be responsible for a research blind spot here.
  This may be a good example of the need for more interdisciplinary
  collaboration.
