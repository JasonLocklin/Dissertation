PhD Project Overview
===================

This the repository for my Phd Dissertation. General Introduction
and Discussion are in the "General" folder. Source for chapters 1,
2, and 3 are in "VWM", "Prisms", and "SA", respectively. 

Each of the chapters also contains the analysis code (Rmd files,
as well as the output html files, which could not be computed
without the orgional data files). Figures are in PDF format, and
the diagramatic ones are also in the origional Inkscape SVG.

Run "make" to combine all the sources into the complete
dissertation. Run "make help" for a list of options"
