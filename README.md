PhD Project --Reading Course
============================

Note: This README file is specific to the 'ReadingCourse' branch of my PhD repo, and should only be commited there. Each branch has it's own README file.

Objectives:
----------
Write a literature review paper as a reading course with James. Eventually, it should be submitted as a publication. 


Topic
-----
Something to do with spacial working memory and saccadic adaptation, or visuomotor adaptation in general. I will probably stand to gain the most from a lit review of S.A. However, I want to explore what little overlap there is in the existing literature between S.A. and the spatial attention and working memory literature. Most S.A. literature concentrates on the psychophysics and low-level neural mechanisms. I want to avoid this in order to make this project as useful as possible to my future thesis writeup. 


Notes
-----
Ongoing notes will be kept chronologically here.
