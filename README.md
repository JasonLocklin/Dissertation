PhD Project --Reading Course
============================

Note: This README file is specific to the 'ReadingCourse' branch of my PhD repo, and should only be commited there. Each branch has it's own README file.

Objectives:
----------
Write a literature review paper as a reading course with James. Eventually, it should be submitted as a publication. 


Topic
-----
Something to do with spacial working memory and saccadic adaptation, or visuomotor adaptation in general. I will probably stand to gain the most from a lit review of S.A. However, I want to explore what little overlap there is in the existing literature between S.A. and the spatial attention and working memory literature. Most S.A. literature concentrates on the psychophysics and low-level neural mechanisms. I want to avoid this in order to make this project as useful as possible to my future thesis writeup. 


Notes
-----
Ongoing notes will be kept chronologically here.

### September 19, 2013
Literature created in Zotero under "Reading Course." I'll periodically export the collection in the folder 'bib' here. I'm not sure what software I will use to write this up with for now, so the 'bib' folder may end up with the list in a couple formats. 

Right now I need to come up with a concrete topic to talk to James about, so I'm just surveying the S.A. lit that I already have.
