In order to assess the impact of saccadic adaptation on landmark
and line bisection performance, it was critical to establish that
participants are, in fact, adapting saccade magnitudes.
Performance on the first third of the first session was used as a
pseudo-baseline, as very little, if any adaptation is expected in
the first 30 trials of saccadic adaptation [@Hopp2004]. If this
assumption is incorrect, this would only make identifying an
effect more difficult.

The test trial data provides a clear indication that saccades
decreased in magnitude over the adaptation blocks, but was not able
to provide a reliable estimate of the magnitude of that change. By
using saccade lengths from all trials, the larger sample sizes
produced much less individual variability, and thus provides a
relatively precise estimate, which coincides with what has been
found in the literature in the past [@Hopp2004]. 
Because
non-test trials included the perturbed target, it's possible that
the target influenced the duration of the initial saccade, biasing
the adaptation effect calculation, though this should be
relatively uniform across participants and blocks, and thus fail
to influence the results. 

The strict trial inclusion criteria was chosen to ensure
confidence that the resulting metrics were not influenced by
artifacts unrelated to the adaptation, however this results in
nearly half the trials being removed from the analysis, which
magnifies the imprecision of estimates based on the test trials. 
Future research should consider
combining higher frequency test trials and more liberal inclusion
criteria. This approach may allow an entire analysis based on test
trials, eliminating the possibility of introducing bias. 

Performance on the landmark and line bisection tasks was precise,
and the experiment was sensitive enough to detect the small
pseudo-neglect observed in healthy individuals in previous
research [@Bowers1980; @Bradshaw1986; @Scarisbrick1987].  Saccadic
adaptation, however, did not produce a measurable change in
landmark or line bisection performance, even though the experiment
had sufficient statistical power to detect very small changes.
