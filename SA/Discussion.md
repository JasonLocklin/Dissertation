In order to assess the impact of saccadic adaptation on landmark
and line bisection performance, it was critical to establish that
participants are, in fact, adapting saccade magnitudes.
Performance on the first third of the first session was used as a
pseudo-baseline, as very little, if any adaptation is expected in
the first 30 trials of saccadic adaptation [@Hopp2004]. If this
assumption is incorrect, this would only make identifying an
effect more difficult.

The sparsity of test-trials in the saccadic adaptation paradigm
raises questions about the reliability of results derived from
them. However, regardless of whether just test-trials or all
trials were used, participants appeared to reliably shorten their
saccades in each block (table [tbl_Adaptation]). While the
test-trial data set provides a clear indication that adaptation
was successful, it is not able to provide a reliable estimate of
magnitude, necessitating calculations based on all trials. When
this was done, adaptation magnitude was typical of that found in
the literature.

Performance on the landmark and line bisection tasks was precise,
and the experiment was sensitive enough to detect the small
pseudo-neglect observed in healthy individuals in previous
research [@Bowers1980, @Bradshaw1986, @Scarisbrick1987].  Saccadic
adaptation, however, did not produce a measurable change in
landmark or line bisection performance, even though the experiment
had sufficient statistical power to detect very small changes. 

The case study made clear that special experimental
considerations, beyond what is typically made for prism
adaptation, need to be made with saccadic adaptation for the task
to work with neglect patients. The design of the stimuli used here
was either insufficient in saliency, or involved too large a
leftward eccentricity to effectively elicit a leftward saccade to
acquire the second target.  Further research attempting saccadic
adaptation may require either a new experimental configuration, or
locating a patient who is only showing weak signs of neglect.
These potential constraints on saccadic adaptation highlight the
relative ease with which patients are able to perform prism
adaptation. For practical reasons, saccadic adaptation may not be
suitable for rehabilitation of neglect.
