### Saccadic Adaptation

[SA worked -test trials] The median saccade length of the test
trials belonging to the first third of the first block of
adaptation trials (i.e., what is being used here as a baseline
measure) were subtracted from the medians of each block's final
third test trials. Because so many trials were removed for poor
data quality, many participant's had individual blocks lacking
sufficient test-trial data to perform this calculation.  Out of
the 41 participants, between 11 and 22 of them did not have at
least 2 acceptable test trials (out of a maximum of 6) from which
to calculate adaptation.  Nevertheless, one-sample t-tests of the
remaining participant blocks were used to determine whether the
adaptation paradigm had successfully shortened saccades, and 3 of
4 blocks showed significant change from baseline (see Figure
[fig_Adaptation]).


[non-test trials] While test trials provide a measure of the
degree of adaptation in the absence of any responses to target
perturbations mid-flight, the sparsity of data when using only
these trials limits the potential power and reliability of further
statistical analysis.  Further, the average change in saccadic
length (including all all blocks) was -69%, which is more than
double the actual target perturbation (30%), and includes an
exceptionally large 95% confidence interval ranging from -100% to
-7%.  Alternatively, if all trials are included instead of just
test-trials, the overall mean saccadic change is -18% (95% CI of
(-0.22, -0.13)). This change represents 60% of the perturbation
distance, which is in line with the typical effect size that has
been found in the literature [@Hopp2004].  Given this, the results
based on all trials, rather than just test trials, are taken to
provide a more reasonable measure of the effect, and is used in
the remainder of this analysis.

\caption{Figure depicts the mean degree of adaptation observed in each
block. Panel (a) is based on only test trials (i.e., those trials where
no target perturbation is displayed), while panel (b) is calculated from
all available trials, including non-test trials. For (a), blocks 1, 3,
and 4 produced significant group change in saccade length
(\(t( 30) = -2.53\), \(\text{p} < 0.05\), \(t( 19 ) = -2.58\),
\(\text{p} < 0.05\), and \(t( 21 ) = -3.07\), \(\text{p} < 0.01\),
respectively), while block 2 did not reach significance
(\(t( 24 ) = -1.8\), \(\text{p} = 0.084\)). Sparsity of data for test
trials required further analysis with all trials in order to quantify
the degree of adaptation reliably. All four blocks of (b) demonstrated
significant adaptation (\(t( 36 ) = -4.62\), \(\text{p} < 0.001\),
\(t( 35 ) = -6.17\), \(\text{p} < 0.001\), \(t( 34 ) = -6.76\),
\(\text{p} < 0.001\), and \(t( 27 ) = -5.88\), \(\text{p} < 0.001\),
respectively). A correction for family-wise error was not applied, as
the blocks should be considered a type of replication. The likelihood of
one of the four test-trial tests producing an erroneously significant
result, by chance, is 0.2. However, the likelihood of 3 erroneous in 4
tests results, as above, would be 0.0001.}

### Landmark and Line bisection

[Parameters of the two tasks at baseline. Correlations]
Participants did not show any significant bias when responding on
the line bisection task pre-adaptation ($t( 48 ) = 0.62$,
$\text{p} = 0.541$). In contrast, performance on the landmark task
indicated a rightward bias such that participants placed the mark
0.24$^\circ$ (0.18cm) to the right of true centre ($t( 48) = 5.6$,
$\text{p} < 0.01$). Such a rightward bias indicated that
participants perceived the left half of the line to be larger, as
has been shown in prior work [Pseudo-neglect; @Bowers1980].
Interestingly, all participants performed very accurately on these
two tasks, with the worst performance still less than a centimetre
from centre (0.8$^\circ$ and 1.0$^\circ$ for line bisection and
landmark, respectively.) Performance on the two tasks was not
significantly correlated ($r = -0.2$, $t(47) = -1.57$,
$\text{p}=0.12$).


[Change scores -null effect] To investigate the potential effect
of saccadic adaptation on landmark and line bisection, change
scores were computed from the initial, pre-adaptation sessions of
the two tasks, to the remaining post-adaptation sessions. One
participant was excluded from line bisection task as they pointed
to the end of the line, rather than centre, after the first block.
When the change scores were averaged across blocks, neither line
bisection, nor landmark task performance showed evidence of change
post-adaptation ($t( 35 ) = -0.55$, $\text{p} = 0.583$, and $t(36)
= -0.88$, $\text{p} = 0.384$, respectively).  Based on the sample
variance and sample size, a power analysis revealed that the
experiment would have had a 95% chance of detecting a
post-adaptation change in the landmark task as small as
0.1$^\circ$ (0.08cm, $n = 37$, $sd = 0.15$), less than half the
pre-existing bias  and a change of 0.12$^\circ$ (0.09cm, $n = 36$,
$sd = 0.14$) in line bisection. 


The degree of adaptation varied from participant to participant,
with a few participants exhibiting mean saccadic change very close
to zero. To examine the influence of saccadic adaptation further,
the above analysis was repeated with only those participants
demonstrating a strong saccadic adaptation effect (The median
saccadic gain, of -16%, was chosen as the cut off).  Again,
landmark and line bisection change scores were non-significant
($t( 17) = -1.89$, $\text{p} = 0.076$, and $t( 17 ) = -0.36$,
$\text{p} = 0.726$, respectively). Note that while this may appear
to hint at the possibility of an effect of adaptation on landmark
performance, the near-criteria p-value seems to be contingent on
the precise cut-off for selecting the participants, so should not
be considered reliable.

Examination of the correlation between degree of adaptation and
landmark and line-bisection change post-prisms was also
non-significant, though landmark performance did approach
significance ($r = 0.29$, $t(35) = 1.84$, $\text{p} = 0.07$, and
$r = -0.06$, $t(34) = -0.39$, $\text{p} = 0.7$, respectively)

### Case Study

[Saccades not toward target but central fixation] The neglect
patient made saccades normally to the first target in the
adaptation task (rightward), however, he was never able to acquire
the second,leftward target. After the first target disappeared,
the patient always returned to the centre of the screen,
anticipating the central fixation which would begin the next
trial. The trial would time-out and the fixation would then
appear. After several unsuccessful attempts to verbally and
manually cue the patient to the second target in the sequence, the
experiment was discontinued.
