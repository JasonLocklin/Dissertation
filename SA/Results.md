### Saccadic Adaptation

[SA worked -test trials] The experimental blocks of saccadic
adaptation were split up into thirds, and the first third of the
first experimental block was used as a pseudo-baseline to compare
with the final thirds of each of the blocks. The median saccade
length of the test trials belonging to that first third were
subtracted from the medians of each block's final third test
trials. Because so many trials were removed for poor data quality,
many participant's had individual blocks lacking sufficient
test-trial data to perform this calculation. Out of the 41
participants, between 11 and 22 of them did not have at least 2
acceptable test trials (out of a maximum of 6) from which to
calculate adaptation. Nevertheless, one-sample t-tests of the
remaining participant blocks were used to determine whether the
adaptation paradigm had successfully shortened saccades, and 3 of
4 blocks showed significant change from baseline (see table
[tbl:Adaptation]).


[non-test trials] While test trials provide a measure of degree of
adaptation in the absense of any responses to target perturbations
mid-flight, the sparsity of data when using only these trials
limits the potential power and reliability of further statistical
analysis.  Further, the average change in saccadic length
(including all all blocks) is -69%, which is more than double the
actual target purturbation (30%), and includes an exceptionally
large 95% confidence interval ranging from -100% to -7%.
Alternatively, if all trials are included instead of just
test-trials, the overall mean saccadic change is -18% (95% CI of
(-0.22, -0.13)). This change represents 60% of the perturbation
distance, which is in line with the typical effect size that has
been found in the literature [tk].  Given this, the results based
on all trials, rather than just test trials, are taken to provide
a more reasonable measure of the effect, and is used in the
remainder of this analysis.

TODO: [tbl:Adaptation] goes about here. Data below:

### Landmark and Line bisection

[Parameters of the two tasks at baseline. Correlations]
Participants did not show any significant bias when responding on
the line bisection task pre-adaptation ($t( 48 ) = 0.62 $,
$\text{p} = 0.541$ ). In contrast, performance on the landmark
task indicated a rightward bias such that participants placed the
mark 0.24º (0.18cm) to the right of true centre ($t( 48) =
5.6$, $\text{p} < 0.01$). Such a rightward bias indicated that
participants perceived the left half of the line to be larger, as
has been shown in prior work [tk pseudo neglect ref].
Interestingly, all participants performed very accurately on these
two tasks, with the worst performance still less than a centimetre
from centre (0.8º and 1.0º for line bisection and
landmark, respectively.) Performance on the two tasks was not
significantly correlated ($r = -0.2$, $t(47) = -1.57$,
$\text{p}=0.12$).


[Change scores -null effect] To investigate the potential effect
of saccadic adaptation on landmark and line bisection, change
scores were computed from the initial, pre-adaptation sessions of
the two tasks, to the remaining post-adaptation sessions. One
participant was excluded from line bisection because they pointed
to the end of the line, rather than center, after the first block.
When the change scores were averaged across blocks, neither line
bisection, nor landmark task performance showed evidence of change
post-adaptation ( $t( 35 ) = -0.55 $, $\text{p} = 0.583$, and
$t( 36 ) = -0.88 $, $\text{p} = 0.384 $ respectively ).  Based
on the sample variance and sample size, a power analysis revealed
that the experiment would have had a 95% chance of detecting a
post-adaptation change in the landmark task as small as 0.1º
(0.08cm, $n = 37$, $sd = 0.15$), less than half the pre-existing
bias  and a change of 0.12º (0.09cm, $n = 36$, $sd = 0.14$)
in line bisection. 


The degree of adaptation varied from participant to participant,
with a few participants exhibiting mean saccadic change very close
to zero. To examine the influence of saccadic adaptation further,
the above analysis was repeated with only those participants
demonstrating a strong saccadic adaptation effect (The median
saccadic gain, of -16%, was chosen as the cut off).  Again,
landmark and line bisection change scores were non-significant (
$t( 17) = -1.89 $, $\text{p} = 0.076 $, and $t( 17 ) = -0.36 $,
$\text{p} = 0.726 $ respectively). Note that while this may appear
to hint at the possibility of an effect of adaptation on landmark
performance, the near-criteria p-value seems to be contingent on
the precise cut-off for selecting the participants, so should not
be considered reliable.

Examination of the correlation between degree of adaptation and
landmark and line-bisection change post-prisms was also
non-significant, though landmark performance did approach
significance ( $r = 0.29$, $t(35) = 1.84$, $\text{p} = 0.07$, and
$r = -0.06$, $t(34) = -0.39$, $\text{p} = 0.7$ respectively )

### Case Study

[Saccades not toward target but central fixation] The neglect
patient made saccades normally to the first target in the
adaptation task (rightward), however, the patient was never able
to aquire the second target. After the first target disappeared,
the patient always returned to the centre of the screen,
anticipating the central fixation which would begin the next
trial. The trial would time-out and the fixation would then
appear. After several unsuccessful attempts to verbally and
manually cue the patient to the second target in the sequence, the
experiment was discontinued.
