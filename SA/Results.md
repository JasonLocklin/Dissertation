### Saccadic Adaptation

#### Adaptation was Effective

In order to determine whether the saccadic adaptation
procedure successfully changed saccade length from baseline,
one-sample t-tests for each block were computed (Figure
\ref{fig_Adaptation}a). A participant experienced 6 test trials
for each of the block thirds used in this calculation, so each
test was run only with participants where the median first saccade
length could be based on at least two accepted trials.
Blocks 1, 3, and 4 produced significant group
change in saccade length
($n=31$, $t( 30) = -2.53$, $\text{p} < 0.05$,
$n=20$, $t( 19 ) = -2.58$, $\text{p} < 0.05$, and
$n=22$, $t( 21 ) = -3.07$, $\text{p} < 0.01$, respectively),
while block 2 did not reach
significance ($n=25$, $t( 24 ) = -1.8$, $\text{p} = 0.084$).
A correction for
family-wise error was not applied, as the blocks should be
considered a type of replication.  While the likelihood of one of the
four test-trial tests producing an erroneously significant result,
by chance, would be $0.2$, the likelihood of 3 erroneous in 4
tests results, as above, is $0.0001$.

#### Magnitude of Adaptation

The test-trials demonstrate significant change post-adaptation
free of potential bias by perturbed targets, but the lack of
individual trial replication results in large individual
variability. The 95% confidence interval for the magnitude of
adaptation ranges from 23% to 330%, where 0% would represent no
change and 100% would indicate eye movements directly to the
perturbed location (i.e., complete adaptation). Thus, adaptation of
330% would indicate severe overcompensation, or an outright error.
To gain a more precise estimate
of adaptation, the analysis was repeated with all trials.  In this
case all four blocks demonstrated significant adaptation
($n=37$, $t( 36 ) = -4.62$, $\text{p} < 0.001$,
$n=36$, $t( 35 ) = -6.17$, $\text{p} < 0.001$,
$n=35$, $t( 34 ) = -6.76$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, and
$n=28$, $t( 27 ) = -5.88$, $\text{p} < 0.001$, respectively).
Overall, this results in an average adaptation magnitude of 60%
(95% CI: 43%--73% adaptation), which is in line with the typical
effect size that has been found in the literature [@Hopp2004].

### Landmark and Line bisection

[Parameters of the two tasks at baseline. Correlations]
Participants did not show any significant bias when responding on
the line bisection task pre-adaptation
($t( 36 ) = 0.57$, $\text{p} = 0.575$).
In contrast, performance on the landmark task
indicated a rightward bias such that participants placed the mark
$0.24^\circ$ ($0.18$cm) to the right of true centre
($t( 36 ) = 5.23$, $\text{p} < 0.001$).
Such a rightward bias indicated that
participants perceived the left half of the line to be larger, as
has been shown in prior work [Pseudo-neglect; @Bowers1980].
Interestingly, all participants performed very accurately on these
two tasks, with the worst performance still less than a centimetre
from true centre ($0.8^\circ$ and $1.0^\circ$ for line bisection and
landmark, respectively.) Performance on the two tasks was not
significantly correlated
($r = -0.3$, $t(35) = -1.71$, $\text{p}=0.1$).


[Change scores -null effect]
After the first block, one participant switched to pointing to the
end of the line, rather than to the centre, and was excluded from this
portion of the line bisection analysis.
When the post adaptation change scores
were averaged across blocks, neither line
bisection, nor landmark task performance showed evidence of a shift
($t( 35 ) = -0.55$, $\text{p} = 0.583$, and $t(36)
= -0.88$, $\text{p} = 0.384$, respectively).  Based on the sample
variance and sample size, a power analysis revealed that the
experiment would have had a 95% chance of detecting a
post-adaptation change in the landmark task as small as
0.1$^\circ$ (0.08cm, $n = 37$, $sd = 0.15$), less than half the
pre-existing bias  and a change of $0.12^\circ$ (0.09cm, $n = 36$,
$sd = 0.14$) in line bisection.


The degree of adaptation varied from participant to participant,
with a few participants exhibiting mean saccadic change very close
to zero. To examine the possible influence of saccadic adaptation further,
the above analysis was repeated with only those participants
who demonstrated a strong saccadic adaptation effect (i.e., median
saccadic gain of -16%, was chosen as the cut off).  Again,
landmark and line bisection change scores were non-significant
($t( 17) = -1.89$, $\text{p} = 0.076$, and $t( 17 ) = -0.36$,
$\text{p} = 0.726$, respectively). Note that while this may appear
to hint at the possibility of an effect of adaptation on landmark
performance, the near-criteria p-value seems to be contingent on
the precise cut-off for selecting the participants, so should not
be considered reliable.

Examination of the correlation between degree of adaptation and
landmark and line-bisection change post-prisms was also
non-significant, though landmark performance did approach
significance ($r = 0.29$, $t(35) = 1.84$, $\text{p} = 0.07$, and
$r = -0.06$, $t(34) = -0.39$, $\text{p} = 0.7$, respectively)
