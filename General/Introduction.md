Introduction
------------

Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder commonly resulting from
damage to the right inferior parietal or superior temporal cortex
[tk]. Hereafter, specifically referred to simply as "neglect," the
disorder causes a heterogeneous collection of deficits that can be
generally categorized as an inability to respond to information on
the contralesional side of space. People with the disorder are
spatially biased away from contralesional space in their search
behaviour [tk], grooming and eating [tk], drawing [tk], posture
[tk], and perceptual judgment of spatial extent [e.g., line
bisection; tk].  The disorder is, as can be expected from the list
of symptoms, debilitating, and is associated with poor
rehabilitative outcome [@Cassidy1998, @Ringman2004].  Less than
half of patents show improvements in the weeks after a neglect
inducing stroke, and a small minority fully recover [Farnè2004@].

[Disorder of Spatial-attention] Most theoretical accounts of the
neglect syndrome describe it as either a deficit of the deployment
of spatial attention, or one of impaired awareness. More
specifically, either an inability to report, respond, or orient
attention toward stimuli in left space [@DriverMattingley1998
,@HalliganVallar2003,@HeilmanValenstein1993] , or a general loss
of environmental awareness that can at it's most extreme, cause a
person to act as if the entire contralesional half of their world
has ceased to exist [@Mesulam1981 ]. The spatial-attention based
model does a good job of explaining many of the deficits displayed
on clinical tests of neglect. For example, object cancellation (a
variant of the visual search task) and figure copying (a free-hand
drawing task) are believably influenced by the patient’s ability
to deploy attention across the page. Where attention cannot be
directed, mistakes or omissions are made. Even for something like
the line-bisection task – in which the patient is asked to place a
mark at the perceived midpoint of a horizontal line – an inability
to attend to an endpoint is a plausible explanation for impaired
performance [i.e., typically marks are placed a long way to the
right of true centre; @tk].

[disengage deficit account] Attentional accounts of neglect
typically invoke two kinds of impairment; first, an ipsilesional
bias such that attention is preferentially oriented toward right
space, and second, a reorienting deficit such that neglect
patients have difficulty disengaging attention from stimuli in
right space in order to reorient towards the left. The so-called
‘disengage deficit’ was first posited as an explanation of the
related phenomenon of extinction – the failure to report a
contralesional stimulus when presented simultaneously with an
ipsilesional stimulus [@tk]. @Posner1984 examined this further
using a covert orienting task in which participants must detect
peripheral targets that can be validly or invalidly cued [i.e.,
cue and target presented at the same or opposite locations
respectively; @Posner1980]. On this task, neglect patients are
disproportionately slower to respond to left sided targets
following a right sided cue – as if they have trouble disengaging
from the cue when presented in right space [see
@BartolomeoChokron2002  and @LosierKlein2001 for reviews].
Similarly, in a visual search task, performance in contralateral
space is driven by the number of ipsilesional distractors
[@EglinKnight1989]. This coincides with a general body of research
that supports the notion that a crucial function of the right
inferior parietal cortex is to disengage attention from the
current focus and reorient toward a new, salient location [for a
review, see @CorbettaShulman2002 and @CorbettaShulman2011].

[Prisms do lot's of things] Given the debilitating nature of the
disorder a broad range of rehabilitation protocols have been
attempted [tk]. Perhaps because of the heterogeneity of the
symptom profile in neglect, most rehabilitation strategies have
met with varied success [@Danckert2006] . Both caloric
stimulation, in which water, often ice-cold, is injected into the
patient's ear canal, and neck muscle vibration, quickly orients
the patient's torso, head, eyes, and attention to the stimulated
side, reducing several of the behavioural deficits for a short
time [\~20 minutes; @AdairHeilman2003
,@KarnathHartje1993,@KarnathDichgans1996,@Rubens1985].
Unfortunately, these exercises are aversive and their short-term
effects prevent them from being useful as treatments. A much more
promising rehabilitation technique based on prismatic glasses has
recently been shown to have broader, and more lasting effects in
neglect [@Rossetti1998; RossiKheyfetsReding1990]. When patients
with neglect are adapted to a rightward visual shift and the
glasses removed, the after-effects on several behavioural measures
are profound, and last considerably longer than the adaptation
time [@FarnèRossetti2002
,@Frassinetti2002,@Pisella2002,@Rossetti1998]. Judgment of
straight-ahead and line bisection become closer to true centre
[@Danckert2006], object cancellation, and figure copying improves
[@Rosetti1998 ], exploratory eye movements demonstrate a reduction
in rightward bias [@Danckert2006,@Ferber2003], and even visual
imagery [@Rode2001 ,@Rode1998], and posture [@Tilikete2001] are
improved by the technique.

[Failures of prisms] Despite the long list of behaviours prisms
have been shown to ameliorate, more recent randomized controlled
trials have failed to show prisms as an efficacious rehabilitation
treatment [@Nys2008 ,@Turton2009]. Additionally, when an effort is
made to examine attention and perception more directly, the
ameliorative effects seem to be somewhat less clear. Some direct
measures of attentional biases have been shown to be affected by
prisms, such as covert shifts of attention
[@Striemer2007,Nijboer2008], and extinction [@Serino2007], while
other, perhaps more realistic measures of attention, such as a
serial visual search task, have failed to show an effect
[@Morris2004]. Similarly, while several studies have shown that
prisms induce a shift in voluntarily eye movements towards
previously neglected space, perceptual judgments can remain just
as biased as before [@Dijkerman2003 ,@Ferber2003]. This appears to
be demonstrating a dissociation between occulomotor "looking" and
perceptual "seeing," with prisms restoring the former but not the
latter [@Danckert2010].

[Speculation on action/perception disassociation in prisms] The
dissociation between after effects that influence actions and
those that influence perception invokes the dual visual pathways
hypothesis of Goodale and Milner [@Milner2006vba]. Information
from primary visual cortex (V1) projects to two streams, one
projecting to the superior, posterior parietal cortex that is
important for the visual guidance of action (the so-called dorsal
‘how’ pathway) and another that projects from V1 to inferotemporal
cortex and is important for perceptual processing [the so-called
ventral ‘what’ pathway; @Milner2006vba]. Prisms have been shown to
primarily influence processing within the dorsal stream [fMRI refs
tk; Luaute2006, Corbetta and gang; @Clower1996 2000’s retroviral
tracing in monkeys].  In this framework, prisms will primarily
influence behaviours supported by the the superior parietal lobule
and infraparietal sulcus, areas well within the dorsal stream that
are typically undamaged in neglect.  Instead, damage to the
inferior parietal/superior temporal gyrus leads not only to the
neglect syndrome, but also severely reduces (or even eliminates)
the brain's ability to integrate dorsal and ventral stream
processing [@Danckert2010]. In the same respect, the damage limits
the ability of a rehabilitative technique such as prisms, that
operates primarily on the dorsal stream,from influencing areas in
the ventral system responsible for higher level perceptual
judgments. This thesis outlines three experiments and a case study
chosen to examine this duality between the reactive, motor action
system, and perceptual representation/awareness in neglect.

[Chapter overview] Chapter 1 explores the relationship between
visual working memory and spatial attention. It examines the
hypothesis that these two domains represent separate, but
interacting deficits in patients with neglect. Chapter 2 employs
prism adaptation in right brain damaged (RBD) participants to
explore the effects of prisms on two domains – spatial working
memory and temporal estimation – that are critical for developing
accurate perceptual representations of the world. This chapter
contributes to the growing evidence that prisms fail to influence
domains of processing important for the construction of perceptual
representations. Chapter 3 develops a procedure for using saccadic
adaptation to explore the possibility that modifying eye position
sense would lead to more generalized improvements in both action
and perception. This preliminary work was conducted in healthy
controls. Chapter 4 presents data from a single case study of a
neglect patient undergoing the saccadic adaptation procedure. The
failures to adapt in this patient points to future directions of
research to address both volitional and reactive saccadic eye
movements.

[Conclude, summarize project] The evidence presented in this
thesis supports the notion that neglect is not *just* a disorder
of attention, but can be characterized by a failure to build
accurate perceptual representations of the world. Prisms appear to
have an effect on the spatial action systems, having such a strong
effect in part *because* of the lack of awareness [@Danckert2010];
however, they do not seem to change the deficits of perceptual
representation. Deficits of perceptual representation, as well as
being central to the disorder, also represent a major contributor
to the debilitating nature of neglect. Concentrating on deficits
of perceptual representation has the potential of making
substantial steps forward in understanding the disorder and
producing more effective rehabilitation efforts.
