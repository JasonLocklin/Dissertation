General Introduction 
======================


Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder commonly resulting from
damage to the right inferior parietal or superior temporal cortex
[@Vallar1986; @Karnath2001; @Karnath2012; @Mort2003; @Buxbaum2004;
@Verdon2010]. Spatial neglect is characterized by a heterogeneous 
collection of
deficits, the most prominent of which is an inability to
respond to information on the contralesional side of space
[@Driver1998; @Halligan2003; @Heilman1993]. 
People
with the disorder are spatially biased away from contralesional
space in their search behaviour [@Husain2001; @Wojciulik2001],
grooming and eating [@Halligan2003; @Kerkhoff2001], drawing
[@Halligan1989], posture [@Rode1997], and perceptual judgment of
spatial extent [@Dijkerman2003; @Striemer2010dpm].  The disorder
is debilitating,
and is associated with poor rehabilitative outcomes [@Cassidy1998;
@Ringman2004].  Less than half of patents show improvements in the
weeks after a neglect inducing stroke, and a small minority fully
recover [@Farne2004].

[Disorder of Spatial-attention] Most theoretical accounts of the
neglect syndrome describe it as either a deficit of the deployment
of spatial attention, or one of impaired awareness. More
specifically, either an inability to report, respond, or orient
attention toward stimuli in left space [@Driver1998;
@Halligan2003; @Heilman1993], or a general loss of environmental
awareness that can at it's most extreme, cause a person to act as
if the entire contralesional half of their world has ceased to
exist [@Mesulam1981]. The spatial-attention based model does a
good job of explaining many of the deficits displayed on clinical
tests of neglect. For example, object cancellation (a variant of
visual search tasks) and figure copying  are arguably influenced
by the patient’s ability to deploy attention across the page.
Where attention cannot effectively be directed,
mistakes or omissions are made. For example, the
line-bisection task --- in which the patient is asked to place a
mark at the perceived midpoint of a horizontal line --- an inability
to attend to the left endpoint is a plausible explanation for impaired
performance [Typically marks are placed a long way to the
right of true centre; @Wilson1987].

[disengage deficit account] Attentional accounts of neglect
typically invoke two kinds of impairment; first, an ipsilesional
bias such that attention is preferentially oriented toward right
space, and second, a reorienting deficit such that neglect
patients have difficulty disengaging attention from stimuli in
right space in order to reorient towards the left. Originally
associated with the related phenomenon of extinction --- the
failure to report a contralesional stimulus when presented
simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus --- the 'disengage
deficit' describes a general attentional "stickiness" where-by
rightward stimuli attract and capture attention to the exclusion
of leftward stimuli [for a review, see @Losier2001].
Posner and colleagues \citeyear{Posner1984}
used a covert orienting task in which participants must detect
peripheral targets that can be validly or invalidly cued [i.e.,
cue and target presented at the same or opposite locations
respectively; @Posner1980]. On this task, neglect patients are
disproportionately slower to respond to left sided targets
following a right sided cue --- as if they have trouble disengaging
from a right sided cue.  Similarly, in a
visual search task, performance in contralateral space is driven
by the number of ipsilesional distractors [@Eglin1989]. This
coincides with a general body of research that supports the notion
that a crucial function of the right inferior parietal cortex is
to disengage attention from its current focus and reorient toward
a new, salient location [for a review, see @Corbetta2002; and
@Corbetta2011].

[Prisms do lot's of things] Given the debilitating nature of the
disorder a broad range of rehabilitation protocols have been
attempted [for a review, see @Luaute2006]. Perhaps because of the
heterogeneity of the symptom profile in neglect, most
rehabilitation strategies have met with varied success
[@Danckert2006]. Both caloric stimulation, in which water, often
ice-cold, is injected into the patient's ear canal, and neck
muscle vibration, quickly orient the patient's torso, head, eyes,
and attention to the stimulated side, reducing several of the
behavioural deficits for a short time [~20 minutes; @Adair2003 ;
@Karnath1993; @Karnath1996; @Rubens1985].  Unfortunately, these
exercises are aversive and their short-term effects prevent them
from being useful as treatments. A much more promising
rehabilitation technique based on prismatic glasses has more recently
been shown to have broader, and longer lasting effects in neglect
[@Rossetti1998; @Rossi1990]. When patients with neglect are
adapted to a rightward visual shift, the
after-effects on several behavioural measures are profound, and
last considerably longer than the adaptation period [@Farne2002;
@Frassinetti2002; @Pisella2002; @Rossetti1998].  Judgment of
straight-ahead and line bisection performance becomes closer to
true centre, object cancellation, and figure copying improves
[@Rossetti1998]. Beyond these clinical tests, exploratory eye 
movements demonstrate a
reduction in rightward bias [@Danckert2006; @Ferber2003], and even
visual imagery [@Rode2001], and postural balance [@Tilikete2001] are
improved by the technique.

[Failures of prisms] Despite the long list of symptoms that prisms
have been shown to ameliorate, more recent randomized controlled
trials have failed to show prisms as an efficacious rehabilitation
treatment [@Nys2008; @Turton2010]. Additionally, when an effort is
made to examine attention and perception more directly, the
ameliorative effects seem to be somewhat less clear. Some direct
measures of attentional biases have been shown to be affected by
prisms, such as covert shifts of attention [@Striemer2007;
@Nijboer2008], and extinction [@Serino2007], while other, perhaps
more naturalistic measures of attention, such as serial visual
search, have failed to show an effect [@Morris2004].
Similarly, while several studies have shown that prisms induce a
shift in voluntarily eye movements towards previously neglected
space, perceptual judgments can remain just as biased toward right
space as before
[@Dijkerman2003; @Ferber2003]. Taken together this research
suggests there is a
dissociation between occulomotor "looking" and perceptual
"seeing," with prisms restoring the former but not the latter
[@Striemer2010tpd].

[Speculation on action/perception disassociation in prisms] The
dissociation between after effects that influence actions and
those that influence perception invokes the dual visual pathways
hypothesis of Goodale and Milner [@Milner2006]. Information
from primary visual cortex (V1) projects to two streams, one
projecting to the superior, posterior parietal cortex that is
important for the visual guidance of action (the so-called dorsal
‘how’ pathway) and another that projects from V1 to inferotemporal
cortex and is important for perceptual processing [the so-called
ventral ‘what’ pathway; @Milner2006]. Prisms have been shown to
primarily influence processing within the dorsal stream 
[@Luaute2006; @Danckert2008; @Corbetta2005; @Clower1996].
In this framework,
prisms will primarily influence behaviours supported by the 
superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus, areas well
within the dorsal stream that are typically undamaged in neglect.
Instead, damage to the inferior parietal/superior temporal gyrus
leads not only to the neglect syndrome, but also severely reduces
(or even eliminates) the brain's ability to integrate dorsal and
ventral stream processing [@Striemer2010tpd]. Similarly, given that
prisms operate primarily on the dorsal stream, this is likely to
limit the influence the technique can have on functioning within 
the ventral system responsible for higher
level perceptual judgments. This thesis outlines three experiments
chosen to examine perceptual biases, as well as related working
memory deficits, with the goal of providing insight into the
greater breadth of cognitive deficits underlying neglect beyond
spatial attention. 


[Chapter overview] Experiment 1 explores the relationship between
visual working memory and spatial attention in neglect. It examines the
hypothesis that these two domains represent separate, but
interacting deficits. Experiment 2 employs
prism adaptation in right brain damaged (RBD) participants to
explore the effects of prisms on two domains ---  spatial working
memory and temporal estimation --- that are critical for developing
accurate perceptual representations of the world. This chapter
contributes to the growing evidence that prisms fail to influence
domains of processing important for the construction of perceptual
representations. Experiment 3 develops a procedure for using saccadic
adaptation to explore the possibility that modifying eye position
sense would lead to more generalized change in perceptual and
motor biases. This preliminary 
work was conducted in healthy individuals.

[Conclude, summarize project] The evidence presented in this
thesis expands on previous work that has identified deficits in
neglect that purportedly go beyond dorsal, spatial attention
networks [@Striemer2010tpd; @Robertson1997; @Husain1997].
Here, working memory and temporal perception are demonstrated to
be impaired in patients with right brain damage, many of whom
presented with symptoms of
neglect, and these deficits do not appear to be strongly linked to
performance on spatial attention tasks. 
Specifically, working memory impairments,
including memory of visual characteristics like colour or
colour-location bindings, are degraded in the patients, and not in
ways predictable from their attention deficits. Further, prism
adaptation, a procedure known to have an effect on spatial
action systems, did not produce reliable improvement in the large
spatial working memory and time perception deficits observed in the patients.
Lastly, saccadic adaptation successfully altered eye movement
parameters, but was not found to influence perceptual or motoric
judgments of centre in the healthy participants. The potential
future research directions involving saccadic adaptation, and more
generally, the observed perceptual and working memory deficits, are
discussed, with the focus on better understanding the breadth of
underlying cognitive deficits in neglect.
