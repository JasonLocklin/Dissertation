Discussion 
==========

[Deficits in Neglect go beyond attention] The
inability to orient spatial attention to left
visual space has long been considered the hallmark
deficit of unilateral neglect [@Danckert2006].  As
outlined earlier, research has increasingly
questioned the notion that this particular deficit
characterizes the primary, or even cardinal
characteristic of the disorder. The damage that
often leads to the disorder happens to straddle
the border between the two visual systems as they
differentiate dorsally and ventrally
[@Danckert2010]. It is therefore perfectly placed
to not only interfere with both systems, but
potentially corrupt late-stage communication
between the systems, producing deficits that
cannot be accounted for by simplistic
single-system, or single-domain, models.


In chapter 1, patients with neglect are
demonstrated to exhibit complex deficits in visual
working memory. Namely, when compared with
controls, they more often fail to successfully
recall and report the colour of stimuli after a
delay. They also mis-report colours when asked to
recall stimuli from a given location, instead
reporting colours of stimuli from other,
competing, locations. While the first deficit
appears to demonstrate a simple deficit of visual
working memory, the latter probably represents a
somewhat more complex problem of binding visual
information in working memory (colour and spatial
location).  The experiment also supports the
notion that these working memory deficits are not
likely to somehow be down-stream effects of more
basic spatial attention deficits. The severity of
the visual working memory deficits from one
patient to the next did not follow in the same
magnitude from deficits on covert orienting, but
appeared to be relatively independent. 



[Prisms are limited] Thus far, one of the most
promising treatments for rehabilitating neglect
has been prism adaptation [tk "the most" too
strong?]. The reason prism adaptation has appeared
so successful, however, may have been a result of
the fact that much of the research has been
restricted to tests that effectively measure
deficits of spatial attention. Besides the popular
covert orienting task, researchers have often used
clinical paper-and-pencil tests such as object
cancellation, figure drawing or copying. Tasks
that are, by their very nature, sensitive to an
inability to orient to the left.  Chapter 2
investigated whether or not prism adaptation would
produce a measurable effect on tasks thought to
measure ventral-stream dependant processing. Tasks
that would presumably not be improved by
remediation of spatial attention in the dorsal
stream, the apparent target of prisms
[@Danckert2008, @Clower1996].  The experiment
replicated the rather established literature
finding that prisms produced a change in the line
bisection task, a deficit that is likely driven,
at least in part, by an inability to orient
leftward, though the effect was far from
clear-cut.  However, when examining the deficits
of spatial working memory in right space, and
temporal estimation, two tasks presumably
un-influenced by deficits of leftward orienting,
prisms appeared to lack any significant
rehabilitative function.  Patients demonstrated
extreme deficits on these two tasks both before
and after prism adaptation.



[SA failed as a replacement.] It was speculated
that an alternative treatment might be saccadic
adaptation, a task not that different from prism
adaptation, but one that has been demonstrated to
produce subtle changes in perception for healthy
individuals. Chapter 3 begins with an examination
of healthy performance on the landmark and line
bisection tasks. The two tasks have been used
before in neglect research as they are very
similar tasks that nevertheless appear to rely
heavily on different visual systems [@tk?].
Healthy participants typically demonstrate very
small biases, compared with neglect patients, on
these tasks. It was therefore suspected that if
saccadic adaptation produced changes in perception
of spatial extent and spatial attention, it may
show up as small changes on the landmark and line
bisection tasks, respectively.  Unfortunately,
though the participants demonstrated adequate
saccadic adaptation, the effect did not appear to
influence either task.  At the same time, a single
case study attempting saccadic adaptation with a
patient with right brain damage and exhibiting
unilateral neglect was unsuccessfully because the
task demands proved too difficult.





The results in the first two chapters involved
small groups of patients with unilateral neglect.
As with any research examining such restricted
populations sizes, this limits the confidence that
can be placed on the external validity of the
results. It cannot be realistically assumed that
such a small sample can exactly represent the
population as a whole. Further, the heterogeneity
of unilateral neglect, both in terms of the extent
of brain damage, and in terms of the particular
type and severity of deficits, makes extrapolating
from a small group particularly fraught. Further
research with larger groups of patients are
required to verify the reliability and validity of
the conclusions made here. 

[SA healthy] Saccadic adaptation failed to produce
a measurable change in landmark and line bisection
results, but there are avenues left unexplored in
examining the possible connections. First, most of
the perceptual after-effects that have been
demonstrated post-saccadic adaptation have been
restricted to spatial illusions immediately before
or after saccades similar to those which were
adapted [@Awater2005, @Collins2006]. Longer
lasting effects appear to be possible, but it may
require careful task design to produce them. The
types of parameters used are likely to be
important, as research has demonstrated that the
type of saccade
[@Schraa-Tam2009,@Johnston2008,@Müri2008], or even
the magnitude of the direction [i.e., +- gain,
@Catz2008, @Golla2008, @Panouillères2012] can
result in very different patterns of brain
activation.  @Garaas2008 was able to identify
long-lasting perceptual effects of saccadic
adaptation, but this involved developing a new,
whole-field adaptation protocol. Future attempts
to change perceptual biases with saccadic
adaptation should consider these parameters, and
should consider the whole-field adaptation
paradigm developed by @Garaas2008.

Beyond the type of adaptation used, it's possible
that the landmark and line bisection tasks were
insufficiently sensitive to reliably measure the
effect. Introducing a horizontal jitter to the
tasks would remove the participant's ability to
rely on the body mid-line as a reference point and
may increase the difficulty, and thus the
sensitivity to subtle biases, of the tasks. If
research was attempted, it's also possible that
calibrating the length of the line to maximize
sensitivity to the participant's spatial bias
might prove effective.


The saccadic adaptation  case study demonstrated
that the task demands of visually following a
rapidly perturbed target on a screen may be too
difficult to be useful with patients suffering
from neglect.  However, the parameters used here
placed the second target somewhat to the left of
centre, so a different choice that places all
targets completely in right space might allow the
task to succeed. Further, increasing the salience
of the targets, by, for example, increasing their
size, brightness, or flashing them at onset may
improve the patient's ability to orient and
saccade toward them.  There are also paradigms
that utilize self-paced, voluntary saccades rather
than the voluntary saccades used here, and there
is evidence that adaptation of voluntary saccades
may rely more heavily on cortical, and less
cerebellar circuits [@Schraa-Tam2009, @Müri2008],
which may be promising for the examination of
unilateral neglect.  The durations that targets
remain on the screen also should be carefully
calibrated to the particular abilities of the
patient population.

It still remains possible that improved
methodologies may enable neglect patients to
successfully undergo saccadic adaptation. However,
the results presented here do not, in any strong
way, suggest that saccadic adaptation appears to
be a strong contender to replace prism adaptation
in the remediation of neglect. In practice, it
appears that prism adaptation more closely
accommodates the abilities of neglect patients, and
the existing body of positive research makes
turning away from prisms appear to be a poor
choice. Instead, future research should remain
considerate of the limitations of prism
adaptation, and the particular domains where they
do and do-not appear to be effective. Research
should concentrate on combining other techniques
with prisms to more completely rehabilitate the
disorder. For example, the working memory results
presented here demonstrate severely degraded
abilities, and considering the importance of
working memory in self-care and everyday
functioning, it seems imperative that prism
adaptation be supplemented with some form of
working memory training to maximize recovery. Some
deficits, like time perception, may require
further training in  strategies to minimize
complications.
