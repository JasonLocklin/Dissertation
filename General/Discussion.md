General Discussion 
=================

[Deficits in Neglect go beyond attention] The inability to orient
spatial attention to left visual space has long been considered
the hallmark deficit of unilateral neglect [@Danckert2006].  As
outlined earlier, research has increasingly questioned the notion
that this particular deficit characterizes the primary, or even
cardinal characteristic of the disorder. The damage that often
leads to neglect happens to straddle the border between the two
visual systems as they differentiate dorsally and ventrally
[@Striemer2010tpd].  It is therefore perfectly placed to not only
interfere with both systems, but potentially corrupt late-stage
communication between the dorsal and ventral streams, producing
deficits that cannot be accounted for by simplistic single-system,
or single-domain, models.


In chapter 1, patients with neglect demonstrated complex deficits
in visual working memory. Namely, when compared with controls,
they failed to successfully recall and report the colour of
stimuli after a delay (figure [fig.VWM_1Target]). They also
mis-reported colours when asked to recall stimuli from a given
location, instead reporting colours of stimuli from other,
competing, locations (figure [fig.VWM_MTarget]).  While the first
deficit appears to demonstrate a simple problem of visual working
memory, the latter probably represents a somewhat more complex
problem of binding visual information (colour and location) in
working memory.  The experiment also supports the notion that
these working memory deficits are not likely to be down-stream
effects of more basic spatial attention deficits.  The severity of
the visual working memory deficits from one patient to the next
did not correlate with the magnitude of deficits observed on
covert orienting, but appeared to be relatively independent. 



[Prisms are limited] Thus far, one of the most promising
treatments for rehabilitating neglect has been prism adaptation
[@Luaute2006].  The reason prism adaptation has appeared to be so
successful, however, may have been a result of the fact that much
of the research has been restricted to tests that effectively
measure deficits of spatial attention. Besides the popular covert
orienting task, researchers have often used clinical
paper-and-pencil tests such as object cancellation, figure drawing
or copying [@Wilson1987], tasks that are, by their very nature,
sensitive to an inability to orient to the left.  Chapter 2
investigated whether or not prism adaptation would produce a
measurable effect on tasks thought to measure ventral-stream
dependant processing spatial working memory and temporal
estimations tasks that would presumably not be improved by
remediation of spatial attention in the dorsal stream, the
apparent target of prisms [@Danckert2008, @Clower1996].  The
experiment replicated findings that prisms produced a change in
line bisection performance, a deficit that is likely driven, at
least in part, by an inability to orient leftward, though the
effect was far from clear-cut.  However, when examining the
deficits of spatial working memory in right space, and temporal
estimation, two tasks presumably un-affected by deficits of
leftward orienting, prisms appeared to lack any significant
rehabilitative function.  Patients demonstrated extreme deficits
on these two tasks both before and after prism adaptation (figure
[fig.SWM] and [fig.TE]).



[SA failed as a replacement. ] It was speculated that saccadic
adaptation may represent a viable alternative treatment of
neglect. Although the task is not that different from prism
adaptation, it has been demonstrated to produce subtle changes in
perception for healthy individuals [@Mack1978, @Awater2005,
@George2008, @Bruno2007, @Zimmermann2009, @Doré-Mazars2005,
@Collins2006, @Garaas2011].  Chapter 3 began with an examination
of healthy performance on the landmark and line bisection tasks.
The two tasks have been used before in neglect research as they
comprise largely similar perceptual properties but may rely on
distinct visual systems [@Striemer2010dpm].  Healthy participants
typically demonstrate very small biases, compared with neglect
patients, on these tasks. It was therefore suspected that if
saccadic adaptation produced changes in perception of spatial
extent and spatial attention, it may show up as small changes on
the landmark and line bisection tasks, respectively.
Unfortunately, though the participants demonstrated adequate
saccadic adaptation, the effect did not appear to influence either
task.  At the same time, a single case study attempting saccadic
adaptation in a neglect patient was unsuccessful because the task
demands proved too difficult.





The results of the first two chapters involved small groups of
patients with unilateral neglect.  As with any research examining
such restricted population sizes, this limits the confidence that
can be placed on the external validity of the results. It cannot
be realistically assumed that such a small sample can exactly
represent the population as a whole. Further, the heterogeneity of
unilateral neglect, both in terms of the extent of brain damage,
and in terms of the particular type and severity of deficits,
makes extrapolating from a small group problematic.  Further
research with larger groups of patients are required to verify the
reliability and validity of the conclusions made here. 

[SA healthy] Saccadic adaptation failed to produce a measurable
change in landmark and line bisection results, but there are
avenues left unexplored in examining the possible reasons for
this.  First, most of the perceptual after-effects that have been
demonstrated post-saccadic adaptation have been restricted to
spatial illusions immediately before or after saccades similar to
those which were adapted [@Awater2005, @Collins2006]. Longer
lasting effects appear to be possible, but it may require highly
specific design elements empirically chosen to maximize them.  The
types of parameters used are likely to be important, as research
has demonstrated that the type of saccade
[@Schraa-Tam2009,@Johnston2008,@Müri2008], or even the magnitude
of the adaptation direction [i.e., +- gain, @Catz2008, @Golla2008,
@Panouillères2012] can result in very different patterns of brain
activation.  @Garaas2011 was able to identify long-lasting
perceptual effects of saccadic adaptation, but this involved
developing a new, whole-field adaptation protocol. Future attempts
to change perceptual biases with saccadic adaptation should
consider these parameters, especially the potential use of
whole-field adaptation [@Garaas2011].

Beyond the type of adaptation used, it is possible that the
landmark and line bisection tasks were insufficiently sensitive to
reliably measure any effect of the adaptation procedure.
Introducing a horizontal jitter to the bisection stimuli may 
remove the participant's ability to rely on the body mid-line as a
reference point and may increase task difficulty, and thus the
sensitivity to any subtle biases, where they exist. It may also
prove fruitful to calibrate the length of the line to maximize
sensitivity to the participant's own spatial bias established at
baseline.


The saccadic adaptation  case study demonstrated that the task
demands of visually following a rapidly perturbed target on a
screen may be too difficult to be a useful tool in rehabilitating
patients suffering from neglect.  However, the parameters used
here placed the second target somewhat to the left of centre.
Placing all targets completely in right space may improve a
patient's chance of successfully performing the task.  Further,
increasing the salience of the targets, by, for example,
increasing their size, brightness, or flashing them at onset, may
improve the patient's ability to orient and saccade toward them.
There are also paradigms that utilize self-paced, voluntary
saccades rather than the reflexive saccades used here, and there
is evidence that adaptation of voluntary saccades may rely more
heavily on cortical as opposed to cerebellar, circuits
[@Schraa-Tam2009, @Müri2008], which may prove promising for the
rehabilitation of unilateral neglect.  Finally the durations that
targets remain on the screen should be carefully calibrated to the
particular abilities of the patient, again maximizing their
chances of completing the task and adapting to the direction and
magnitude of shift desired.

It remains possible that improved methodologies may enable neglect
patients to successfully undergo saccadic adaptation. However, the
results presented here do not, in any strong way, suggest that
saccadic adaptation appears to be a strong contender to replace
prism adaptation in the remediation of neglect. In practice, it
appears that prism adaptation more closely accommodates the
abilities of neglect patients, and the existing body of positive
research makes turning away from prisms appear to be a poor
choice. Instead, future research should remain considerate of the
limitations of prism adaptation, and the particular domains where
they do and do-not appear to be effective. Research should
concentrate on combining other techniques with prisms to more
completely rehabilitate the disorder. For example, the working
memory results presented here demonstrate severely degraded
abilities. Considering the importance of working memory in
self-care and everyday functioning, it seems imperative that prism
adaptation be supplemented with some form of working memory
training to maximize recovery.
