Discussion 
==========

[Reiterate Findings]

* Deficits in Neglect go beyond spatial attention (Ch1)

* Prisms do poorly at rehab of non-spatial, lateralized, deficits, like,
    for instance, the attention bias (Ch2).

* SA failed as a replacement.





[Big Picture]

* Emphasize that rehab programs will need to take into account
    non-spatial deficits.





[Limitations] 

* n

* SA -Methods, horizontal jitter, various parameters. Couch in terms
    that it might not be worthwhile.




[Future Directions]

* Adding WM training to Prisms.




[Concluding Paragraph]
