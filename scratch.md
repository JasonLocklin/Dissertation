Participants performing a covert orienting task while undergoing fMRI
imaging exhibited significantly attenuated activity in undamaged areas
of visual cortex, posterior parietal cortex (particularily the
intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal lubule), and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex [@Corbetta2005]. @Corbetta2005 describes this set of
structural dysfunction in the dorsal visual stream as producing
functional deficits in two interacting frontoparietal attention
networks.

[Voluntary attention is superior parietal] The deployment of attention
can be described as being driven by two, competing factors: the
*top-down*, cognitive, modulation based on current task goals, such as
monitoring one's movements during manual operations (like making a
sandwich), and *bottom up* factors reflecting the brain's sensitivity
for discovery of salient features like sudden movement, high contrast
colour, faces, etc. @Corbetta2002 makes the claim that these two
functions reside in structurally destinct frontoparietal attention
networks, with the superior parietal cortex hosting the more vouluntary,
top-down system and more ventral areas like the intraparietal sulcus and
inferior frontal gyrus generating the attention capturing signals that
drive bottom-up attentional reoirienting [for more discusssion, see
@Corbetta2002].
