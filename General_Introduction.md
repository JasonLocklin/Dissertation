Introduction
-----------

Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder that can result from damage
to the right inferior parietal cortex, a lesion that commonly caused
by right posterior cerebral artery infarction [tk]. Hereafter,
specifically referred to simply as "neglect," the disorder causes a
heterogenous collection of deficits that can be generally
categorized as an inability to respond to information on the
contralesional side. People with the disorder are spatially biased
away from contralesional space in their search behavior [tk],
grooming and eating [tk], drawing [tk], posture [tk], and perceptual
judgement of spatial extent [e.g., line bisection; ] among other
things. The disorder is, as can be expected from the list of
symptoms, debilitating, and the risk of bumping into objects [tk]
can affect mobility. Less than half of patents show improvements
in the weeks after a neglect inducing stroke, and a small minority
fully recover [Farnè2004@!].

[Disorder of Spatial-attention] Most theoretical accounts of the
neglect syndrome describe it as either a deficit of the deployment
of spatial attention, or one of awareness. More specifically, either
an inaiblity to report, respond, or orient attention toward stimuli
in left space
[@DriverMattingley1998!,@HalliganVallar2003!,@HeilmanValenstein1993!]
, or a general loss of environmental awareness that can at it's
most extreme, cause a person to act as if the entire contralesional
half of their world has ceased to exist [@Mesulam1981!]. The
spatial-attention based model does a good job of explaining many of
the deficits displayed on the clinical tests of neglect. For
example, object cancellation (a visual search task) and figure
copying (a free-hand drawing task) are believably influenced by the
testee's ability to deploy attention across the page. Where
attention cannot be directed, mistakes or ommissions are are made.
Even for something like the "line-bisection task," where the patient
is asked to medially bisect a horizontal line, an inability to
attend to an endpoint is very plausibly affect performance.

[disengage deficit account] To be more precise about what is meant
by spatial bias, it could be that attention is preferentially
oriented toward ipsilesional space, or, it could be that once there,
neglect patients have dificulty disengaging their attention away
from that ipsilesional space. This distinction is more obvious in a
different, but related and often comorbid disorder called
extinction. When a person with extinction is cued to stimuli in
either ipsilesional or contralesional space, they are able to orient
and report the stimuli. However, when stimuli are presented on both
sides, he is only able to report the stimuli on the ipselesional
side [see @Milner1997! and @Rafal1996! for review]. In a similar
vein, when engaged in a covert orienting task, neglect patients show
the strongest deficits not in orienting toward contralesional
targets generally, but only following cues to ipsilateral space,
from which they would have had to then disengage away from in order
to orient to the contralateral targets effectively [see
@BartolomeoChokron2002! and @LosierKlein2001! for reviews].
Simmilarily, in a visual search task, performance in contralateral
space is driven by the number of ipsilesional distractors
[@EglinKnight1989!]. This coincides with a general body of research
that supports the notion that a crucial function of the inferior
parietal cortex is to disengage attention from it's current focus
and reorint toward a new location [for a review, see
@CorbettaShulman2002!]

[Prisms do lot's of things] As a heterogenious disorder involving
quite widely-encompasing behavioral systems, rehabilitation
strategies with neglect have met with varied success [@Danckert2006]
. Chaloric stimulation, where water, often ice-cold, is sprayed in
the patient's ear canal, or vibration stimulation on the patient's
neck, quickly orients the patient's torso, head, eyes, and attention
to the stimulated side, reducing several of the behavioral deficits
for a short time
[@AdairHeilman2003!,@KarnathHartje1993!,@KarnathDichgans1996!,@Rubens1
985!]. Unfortunately, these exercises are aversive and their
short-term effects prevent them from being usefull as treatments. A
much more promising rehabilitation technique based on prismatic
glasses was developed by @Rossetti1998/Rossi, KheyfetsReding1990.
When patients with neglect are adapted to a rightward visual shift
and the glasses removed, the after-effects on several behavioral
measures are profound, and last considerably longer than the
adaptation time
[@FarnèRossetti2002!,@Frassinetti2002!,@Pisella2002!,@Rossetti1998!]
. Judgement of straight-ahead and line bisection became closer to
true center [@Danckert2006], object cancellation, and figure copying
improves [@Rosetti1998!], and exploratory eye movements become less
biased
[@Danckert2006,@Ferber2003!,@Rode2001!,@Rode1998!,@Tilikete2001!].

[Failures of prisms] Despite the long list of findings that prisms
ameliorate neglect symptoms, more recent randomized control trials
have failed to show prisms as an efficatious rehabilitation
treatment [@Nys2008!,@Turton2009!]. Additionally, when an effort to
examine attention and perception more directly, the ameliorative
effects seem to become somewhat less clear. Some direct measures of
attentional biases have been shown to be effected by prisms, such as
covert shifts of attention [@Striemer2007,Nijboer2008!], and
extinction [@Serino2007!], while other, perhapse more realistic
measures of attention, like a serial visual search task that
measures attention, have failed to show an effect [@Morris2004!].
Similarily, while the fact that prisms cause patients to begin
voluntarily making eye movements into their neglected hemifield has
been well established, perceptual judgements can remain just as
biased as before [@Dijkerman2003!,@Ferber2003!]. This appears to be
demonstrating a dissasociation between occulomotor "looking" and
perceptual "seeing," with prisms restoring the former but not the
latter [@Danckert2010].

[Speculation on action/perception dissasociation in prisms] In the
past, @Danckert2010 has argued that the apparent dissasociation
between the effects of prism adaptation on action and perceptual
deficits can be accounted for if prisms act on circuits of the
dorsal visual stream -specifically the superior parietal lobule and
inferior parietal sulcus, areas well within the dorsal stream that
are typically conserved in neglect patents. When the inferior
parietal/superior temporal gyrus damage leads to neglect, it does so
in part by severely reducing the brain's ability to integrate dorsal
and ventral stream processing [@Danckert2010]. In the same respect,
the damage limits the ability of a superior parietal technique, like
prisms, from influencing areas in the ventral system responsible for
higher level perceptual judgements.  Here, we discuss 3 experiments
and a case study chosen to examine this duality between the
reactive, motor action system, and perceptual
representation/awareness in neglect.

[Chapter overview] Chapter 1 explores the relationship between
visual working memory and spatial attention. It examines the
hypothesis that these two domains represent separate deficits in
patients with neglect. Chapter 2 employs prism adaptation in right
brain damaged (RBD) participants to explore the effects of prisms on
two domains – spatial working memory and temporal estimation – that
are critical for developing accurate perceptual representations of
the world. This chapter contributes to the growing evidence that
prisms fail to influence domains of processing important for the
construction of perceptual representations. Chapter 3 develops a
procedure for using saccadic adaptation to explore the possibility
that modifying eye position sense would lead to more generalised
improvements in both action and perception. This preliminary work
was conducted in healthy controls. Chapter 4 presents data from a
single case of a neglect patient undergoing the saccadic adaptation
procedure. The failures to adapt in this patient points to future
directions of research to address both volitional and reactive
saccadic eye movements.

[Conclude, summarize project] Here, we consider that neglect is,
most centrally, a disorder of awareness. Prisms appear to have an
effect on the spatial action systems, having such a strong effect in
part *because* of the lack of awareness [@Danckert2010]; however,
they don't seem to change the deficits of perceptual awareness
themselves. The lack of awareness, besides being central to the
disorder, is also a major contributor to the debilitating nature of
neglect. Concentrating on the deficits of perceptual representation
has the potential of making substantial steps forward in
understanding the disorder and producing more effective
rehabilitation efforts. Chapter 3 and 4 examine saccadic adaptation
as a potential alternative to prism adaptation in neglect. The
results provide the case that while this task design appears
unfruitful, they also provide some insight into potential
alternatives for future research.
